        Mental Powers <i>(balàni) </i>are thus called because &quot;they 
        overpower opposing mental states&quot; [1]. Or, as the commentaries 
        explain: they are powerful in the sense of being unshaken <i>(akampanatthena) 
        </i>by opposition [2].</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Parallel to the Faculties, 
        there are five Powers </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(bala):</font></p>
        <blockquote>

        3. <i>Sati </i>(Mindfulness)<br>
        4. <i>Samàdhi </i>(Concentration)<br>
        <i>5. Pannà </i>(Wisdom).</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They are like five generals 
        or commanders engaged in destroying the hostile kingdom of Personality 
        Belief.<i> </i>They are the fivefold strength on which Bhikkhus and 
        layfolk can place their reliance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As in the case of the 
        Faculties, the Power of Faith <i>(saddhà-bala) </i>is of two kinds:<i> </i>1. 
        The Power of Ordinary Faith <i>(pakati-saddhà), </i>2. the Power of 
        Developed Faith </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(bhàvanà-saddhà).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ordinary Faith&quot;, 
        which has no development through specific practice, associates with 
        Craving <i>(tanhà)</i> according to circumstances, and can thus produce 
        only the ordinary good actions <i>(pakati-kusala-kamma) </i>of 
        Almsgiving (Liberality;<i> dàna), </i>Morality<i> (sìla), </i>etc.<i> </i>The 
        limited measure of strength it possesses, cannot overcome Craving.<i> </i>On 
        the contrary, Craving <i>(tanhà) </i>keeps &quot;Ordinary Faith&quot; 
        under its power.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is how Craving keeps 
        Ordinary Faith under its power:- The Pàli texts mention, with the 
        greatest clarity, four &quot;Traditional Practices of the Noble 
        Ones&quot; <i>(ariya-vamsa</i>) [3]. They are:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Being easily satisfied 
          with food;<br>
          2. Being easily satisfied with clothing;<br>
          3<i>. </i>Being easily satisfied with any dwelling place;<br>
          4. Finding pleasure and enjoyment in the work of <i>bhàvanà </i>(meditation).</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They constitute the realm 
        of <i>saddhà </i>[4].<i> </i>In the present-day world, this great 
        kingdom of <i>saddhà </i>lies hidden and submerged.<i> </i>Today, 
        beings take pleasure and enjoyment in material things <i>(paccayàmisa): 
        </i>they take pleasure and enjoy-ment in worldly rank, dignity, and 
        honour <i>(lokàmisa); </i>they take pleasure and enjoyment in the 
        attainment of the pleasant life, in worldly riches, and in power and 
        dominion <i>(vattàmisa);</i> and thus is the great kingdom of <i>tanhà 
        </i>established as clearly as the great ocean round the island.<i> </i>This 
        shows the weakness of Ordinary Faith <i>(pakati-saddhà) </i>in this 
        world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is Developed Faith which 
        has its genesis in the successful practice of Body Contemplation (such 
        as Mindfulness on Breathing) -- being pursued until disappear-ance of 
        the distraction and unsettled condition of the mind -- that can dispel 
        Craving <i>(tanhà) </i>which takes pleasure and enjoyment in the 
        afore-mentioned three kinds of worldliness <i>(àmisa). </i>It is this 
        Developed Faith <i>(bhàvanà saddhà) </i>that can save Bhikkhus and 
        lay-folk who are in the course of being drowned and submerged in the 
        ocean of the three Cravings [5], and that enables them to reach the 
        island haven of the kingdom of<i> saddhà, </i>as manifested (e.g.) in 
        the four Traditional Practices of the Noble <i>(ariya-vamsa-dhamma). </i>In 
        the context of the <i>Bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</i> it is this Developed 
        Faith that should be acquired.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the two kinds of Energy <i>(viriya), 
        </i>Ordinary Energy, which is without development practice, associates 
        with laziness <i>(kosajja) </i>according to the occasion and produces 
        the ordinary good acts <i>(pakati-kusala-kamma) </i>of Liberality 
        (Almsgiving), Morality, the study of the sacred texts, etc.<i> </i>This 
        Ordinary Energy cannot dispel laziness.<i> </i>On the contrary, it is 
        laziness which controls Ordinary Energy and keeps it under subjection.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When beings encounter a 
        Buddha Sàsana, they acquire the knowledge that in the past unfathomable 
        Samsàra they have been the kinsfolk of Personality Belief <i>(sakkàya-ditthi),</i> 
        of Evil Deeds <i>(duccarita) </i>and the inhabitants of the Lower Worlds 
        of Misery <i>(apàya-loka). </i>The Pàli texts clearly prescribe the 
        method of the Ariya-vamsa, the Traditional Practice of the Noble, as a 
        way of dispelling laziness; and the fourth of them, delight in 
        meditation, should be practised until release from such a state of 
        laziness (being Energy’s opposite) is attained.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The way of dispelling 
        laziness may be thus described (in the case of a monk) [6]. Having 
        equipped himself with the <i>Sikkhàs </i>(the Training Rules -- which 
        are the Buddha's heritage) and which the monk undertakes in the 
        Ordination Hall at the time of his becoming a<b> </b>Bhikkhu, he, in 
        accordance with these Training Rules [7],</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* makes the trees and 
          bushes of the forest his dwelling-<i> </i>place,<br>
          * lives only on alms-food gathered on his alms-round, avoids company,<br>
          * observes the Dhutanga (strict ascetic practices),</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">and applies himself 
        scrupulously to mindful Body Contemplation, -- these are the acts of 
        Energy that dispel the unwholesome volitional actions <i>(akusala kamma) 
        </i>arising out of laziness <i>(kosajja). </i>They are acts comprised in 
        the realm of <i>viriya </i>(energy).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This realm of Energy 
        remains obscure and is unknown in the present-day world.<i> </i>Today, 
        although Bhikkhus are aware that they belong to that class of beings 
        still possessed of Personality Belief and evil deeds and liable to 
        rebirth in lower worlds of misery, yet they live permanently in 
        dwellings constructed in towns and villages by their donors; they take 
        pleasure in the receipt of large gifts and benefits, they are unable to 
        dispense with the company of other people, etc., all of which acts are 
        comprised within the realm of Laziness <i>(kosajja) </i>and this realm 
        of Laziness is as conspicuous as the sea that inundates an<b> </b>island.<i> 
        </i>This shows the weakness of Ordinary Energy </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(pakati-viriya).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is only Developed Energy 
        <i>(bhàvanà-viriya) -- </i>such as being satisfied with a minimum of 
        sleep, being always alert and active, being fearless, being bold and 
        firm in living alone, being steadfast in meditative practice -- that can 
        dispel Laziness.<i> </i>In the context of the <i>Bodhipakkhiya-dhammà </i>(Requisites 
        of Englihtenment) it is this Developed Energy that should be acquired.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The detailed meaning of the 
        Powers of Mindfulness, Concentration and Wisdom may be known by 
        following the lines of the explanation given above.<i> </i>Here I shall 
        just give a concise explanation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The antithesis of 
        Mindfulness <i>(sati) </i>is<i> mutthasacca,</i> confused Mindfulness or 
        absentmindedness.<i> </i>It means inability to become absorbed in the 
        work of Tranquillity Meditation <i>(samatha bhàvanà) </i>or of Insight 
        Meditation <i>(vipassanà-bhàvanà);</i> inability to concentrate and 
        to control one's mind; the wandering of thoughts to objects other than 
        the object of concentration.<i> </i>Ordinary Mindfulness that one 
        possesses in a rudimentary state from birth cannot dispel that 
        absentmindedness.<i> </i>Only Developed Mindfulness can do it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The antithesis of 
        Concentration <i>(samàdhi) </i>is<i> </i>Distraction <i>(vikkhepa) </i>of 
        mind (i.e. wandering thoughts and idle fancies). It is the inability to 
        concentrate, to control the mind and keep its attention fixed on one 
        object.<i> </i>It is the arising of thoughts on objects other than the 
        object of concentration.<i> </i>It is the unquiet and restless state of 
        mind when applying itself to the work of meditation.<i> </i>Ordinary 
        Concentration cannot dispel the unwholesome state of Distraction.<i> </i>Only 
        Developed Concentration <i>(bhàvanà-samàdhi) </i>can do it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The antithesis of Wisdom <i>(pannà) 
        </i>is Delusion <i>(sammoha).</i> It is ignorance, lack of clarity, 
        mistiness and absence of lucidity of mind.<i> </i>It is the darkness 
        shrouding the mind.<i> </i>This Delusion cannot be removed by Ordinary 
        Wisdom <i>(pakati-pannà), </i>nor by erudition <i>(pariyatti-pannà), </i>which 
        may comprise knowledge of the whole Ti-Pitaka.<i> </i>It is only Wisdom 
        Developed by Meditation <i>(bhàvanà-pannà) </i>that has set up 
        mindful Body Contemplation, which can gradually dispel Delusion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This shows the meaning of 
        the five unwholesome opposites<i> (patipakkha-akusala-dhamma) </i>coupled 
        with the respective Powers </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(bala).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These five unwholesome 
        opposing forces are:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Craving <i>(tanhà), <br>
        </i>(2) Laziness <i>(kosajja), </i>or inability to take pains 
        (lassitude), or lack of fearlessness in Dhamma practice <i>(patipatti), <br>
        </i>(3) Absent-mindedness <i>(mutthasacca), <br>
        </i>(4) Distraction <i>(vikkhepa), </i>and <br>
        (5) Delusion<i> (sammoha). </i></font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The five things that can 
        counteract and dispel them are called Powers <i>(bala). </i>If any one 
        of these Powers is weak and unable to dispel the respective opposite, 
        meditation, be it Tranquillity or Insight, cannot be very successful as 
        far as <i>Neyya </i>individuals are concerned, i.e. those in need of 
        guidance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, at the present day, 
        some persons can emerge out of the realm of Craving <i>(tanhà)</i> 
        because of the strength of their Power of Faith <i>(saddhà-bala). </i>They 
        are rid of attachment to material things and to worldly dignities and 
        honours.<i> </i>But as they are deficient in the other four Powers, they 
        are unable to rise above the stage of contentment <i>(santuttthi) </i>with 
        their living conditions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some persons can emerge out 
        of the realm of Craving and Laziness because they are strong in the 
        Powers of Faith and Energy.<i> </i>They are constant in keeping to a 
        life of contentment, and (if monks) firm in keeping to forest -- and 
        hill dwellings and in the observance of the strict ascetic practices <i>(dhutanga; 
        </i>as exemplifying their energy).<i> </i>But as they are weak in the 
        other three Powers, they are unable to practise mindful Body 
        Contemplation, or do the work of Tranquillity and Insight meditation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some persons, again, are 
        strong in the first three Powers and thus can rise up to the work of 
        mindful Body Contemplation <i>(kàyagatà sati), </i>achieving 
        concentration, e.g., on out-and in-breath or in contemplating the bones 
        of the body.<i> </i>But being deficient in the other two Powers, they 
        cannot rise up to the task of <i>Jhàna </i>and Insight.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Other persons can achieve 
        the attainment of <i>Jhàna </i>because they are strong in the first 
        four Powers, but as the Power of Wisdom is weak in them, they cannot 
        rise to the work of Insight<i> (vipassanà). </i>Some persons are strong 
        in the Power of Wisdom as far as their learning in Dhamma and Ti-Pitaka 
        is concerned.<i> </i>They are also wise in understanding the teachings 
        on the ultimate realities <i>(paramattha dhamma). </i>But because they 
        lack the backing of the other four Powers they cannot emerge from the 
        realm of Craving, Lassitude, Absent-mindedness and Distraction.<i> </i>They 
        live and die within the confines of these unwholesome states.<i> </i>In 
        this way, whenever one is deficient in anyone of the Powers, one cannot 
        rise above the realm of the respective opposite force.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the five Powers, those 
        of Energy and Wisdom are also <i>Iddhipàdas,</i> &quot;Bases of 
        (Spiritual) Success&quot;.<i> </i>Hence, if these two Powers are strong 
        and coordinated, it does not happen that one cannot rise up to the work 
        of Insight <i>(vipassanà)</i> because of the weakness of the other 
        three Powers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">People who do not know the 
        functions of the Bases of Success<i> (iddhipàda), </i>the Controlling 
        Faculties <i>(indriya) </i>and the Powers <i>(bala), </i>do not know why 
        their zeal is weak and which are the opposing forces <i>(patipakkha) </i>that 
        assail them.<i> </i>They do not know the qualities of mind which they 
        have to cultivate, and, hence, the desire to cultivate them never 
        arises.<i> </i>It is thus that the Traditional Practices of the Noble <i>(ariya-vamsa) 
        </i>are on the verge of disappearing at the present day.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I shall give an 
        illustration.<i> </i>There is a species of bull called<i> usabha. </i>It 
        is a bull worth more than a thousand ordinary bulls.<i> </i>If the 
        characteristics and distinctive signs of that bull be recognised, and it 
        be reared and nurtured properly, its limbs and marks will develop, and 
        its strength and powers will increase.<i> </i>It can then guard even a 
        hundred cattle pens from the incursions of lions and leopards.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the owner of such a bull 
        is ignorant of all these, and if thus he does not rear and nurture it 
        properly but keeps and tends it just as he would any other ordinary 
        bull; if he employs it in ploughing and drawing carts in company with 
        other bulls; its distinctive marks and limbs will fail to develop, and 
        its strength and powers will remain dormant.<i> </i>It will thus live 
        and die just like any other bull.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A knowing owner, however, 
        will separate such a bull from the rest and keep it in a specially 
        constructed shed.<i> </i>He will cover the floor of the shed with clean 
        sand and will fix a ceiling to the roof.<i> </i>He will keep the shed 
        clean and will feed the bull with paddy and pulses fit for human 
        consumption.<i> </i>He will wash and bathe it.<i> </i>In such a case, 
        the distinctive marks and limbs will develop, and its strength and 
        powers will increase enormously.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this Buddha Sàsana,<i> 
        Neyya </i>individuals (requiring guidance) resemble the owner of the 
        bull.<i> </i>The five Powers of these <i>Neyya </i>individuals resemble 
        the <i>usabha </i>bull.<i> </i>The Satipatthàna Vibhanga, 
        Sammappadhàna Vibhanga, Iddhipàda Vibhanga, Indriya Vibhanga, 
        Bojjhanga Vibhanga, and Magganga Vibhanga, of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, and 
        the Mahà-satipatthàna Sutta, Satipatthàna Samyutta, Sammappam dhàna 
        Samyutta, Iddhipàda Samyutta, Indriya Samyutta, Balam Samyutta, and 
        Bojjhanga Samyutta of the Sutta Pitaka, resemble the expository books 
        which expound the distinctive signs, marks and characteristics, of <i>usabha 
        </i>bulls, the methods how such bulls are to be reared and taken care 
        of, and the strength and powers that such bulls can attain if reared and 
        nurtured properly.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those<i> Neyya </i>individuals, 
        who through ignorance do not attempt to develop the five Powers through 
        the work of meditation and who thus remain satisfied with the lower 
        attainments within the Sàsana, such as <i>dàna, sìla, </i>and the 
        study of scriptures, resemble the ignorant owner of an <i>usabha </i>bull 
        who does not rear and nurture it properly.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this world, there are 
        many kinds of worldly undertakings.<i> </i>There are undertakings that 
        can be accom-plished by the strength of wealth, and there are 
        undertakings that can be accomplished by the strength of knowledge.<i> </i>Even 
        in the case of the cultivation of land, several kinds of strength are 
        needed for its accomplishment.<i> </i>Sometimes the strength of wealth 
        has to be garnered first, and at other times the strength of knowledge.<i> 
        </i>Preparatory education and study constitute the garnering of the 
        strength of knowledge.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly, in the Buddha 
        Sàsana, there are five Powers needed for the work of <i>samatha, 
        vipassanà, </i>and the attainment of the Holy Paths and Fruits and 
        Nibbàna.<i> </i>It is only when these Powers are first accumulated that 
        the great works mentioned can be undertaken.<i> </i>Those persons who do<b> 
        </b>not possess even one of the five Powers cannot evoke a desire to 
        undertake these great tasks.<i> </i>It does not occur to them that those 
        great tasks can be accomplished in this life.<i> </i>They live 
        forgetfully and without determination.<i> </i>If it is pointed out to 
        them that the tasks can be accomplished, they do not wish to hear it.<i> 
        </i>They do not know that such untoward thoughts occur to them because 
        they are utterly impoverished in their spiritual Powers.<i> </i>They lay 
        the blame at the door of <i>pàrami,</i> or <i>dvihetuka, </i>or at the 
        unfavourable times [8].</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If, however. these people 
        set up work in one of the <i>satipatthàna, </i>such as in <i>ànàpàna 
        sati, </i>and if thereby they set up the three Powers of <i>saddhà, 
        viriya, </i>and<i> sati, </i>such untoward thoughts will certainly 
        disappear.<i> </i>It is inevitable that new wholesome thoughts must 
        arise.<i> </i>This is because they have developed their strength.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is how the strength is 
        developed.<i> </i>Although such a person cannot as yet attain an insight 
        into Body and Mind, the weak Faith grows through the control exercised 
        over Craving <i>(tanhà) </i>for material wants <i>(paccayàmisa) </i>and 
        worldly achievements <i>(lokàmisa). </i>The weak Energy grows through 
        control of lassitude.<i> </i>Weak Mindfulness grows through control of 
        absent-mindedness.<i> </i>Concentration and Wisdom, too, gather strength 
        through control of distraction and delusion.<i> </i>When these Powers 
        grow, it is inevitable that there must be a change in the mind of the 
        meditator.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A person who is afflicted 
        with a major disease has no desire to take an interest in the ordinary 
        affairs and activities of the world.<i> </i>But if, after taking proper 
        medicine and treatment, his grave illness is gradually cured and he is 
        aroused from his apathy, it is inevitable that he will again take 
        interest in normal activities.<i> </i>Here, the five unwholesome 
        opposing forces, i.e. craving, lasssitude, etc., resemble major 
        diseases.<i> </i>The work of Tranquillity and Insight meditation 
        resembles the affairs and activities of the world.<i> </i>Work in the 
        field of Satipatthàna, such as Mindfulness of Breathing, resembles the 
        proper medicines and treatment taken.<i> </i>The rest of this comparison 
        can be easily understood.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence did the Buddha say: 
        &quot;He develops the Powers of Faith, Energy, Mindfulness, 
        Concentration and Wisdom&quot; </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(saddhàbalam

        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this world, the strength 
        of builders lies in good tools, such as awls, chisels, axes, knives, 
        saws, etc.<i> </i>Only when equipped with such tools can they undertake 
        to build.<i> </i>Similarly, in the Sàsana, the tools of Tranquillity 
        and Insight meditation <i>(samatha </i>and<i> vipassanà) </i>for 
        achieving the knowledge of the Paths and Fruitions of Sainthood <i>(magga</i>-and 
        <i>phala-nàna) </i>consist of Developed Faith, Developed Energy, 
        Developed Mindfulness, Developed Concentration and Developed Wisdom <i>(bhàvanà-saddhà, 
        </i>etc.), which are developed through one of the Satipatthànas, such 
        as Mindfulness of Breathing.<i> </i>These five Powers are the strength 
        of meditators <i>(yogàvacara). </i>Hence these five Powers must be 
        developed in order to undertake successfully the work of Tranquillity 
        and Insight meditation within the Buddha Sàsana.<i> </i>This is the 
        meaning of the word <i>bhàveti </i>(he develops) in the text quoted 
        above.</font></p>
