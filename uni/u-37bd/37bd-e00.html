        PREFACE</b></font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With the present volume we 
        present to our readers another treatise by the eminent Burmese 
        scholar-monk, the late Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, whose Life Sketch appears 
        in a work of his, published earlier in this series, &quot;A Manual of 
        Insight&quot; (Vipassanà Dipani) (&quot;The Wheel&quot; No. 31/32).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We believe that this 
        present treatise is one of the most helpful expositions of Dhamma which 
        we have been privileged to publish in &quot;The Wheel&quot; series. It 
        offers not only a wealth of information on many aspects of the Teaching, 
        but is also a forcefully reasoned and stirring appeal to earnest 
        endeavour towards the Goal. We therefore, wish to recommend this work to 
        our readers’ close and repeated study and reflection.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This treatise has been 
        reproduced from the journal The Light of the Dhamma (Rangoon), which 
        regrettably has ceased publication. For permission of reprint we are 
        grateful to the publishers, The Union of Burma Buddha Sàsana Council, 
        Rangoon.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the present edition, 
        many of the Pàli terms used in the original translation have been 
        supplemented or replaced, by the English equivalents, for facilitating 
        the reading of the treatise. The last chapter has been condensed. 
        Otherwise only minor changes have been made in the diction.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the original 
        publication, the term bodhipakkhiya-dhamma had been rendered by 
        &quot;Factors leading to Enlightenment&quot;, which, however, resembles 
        too closely the customary translation of the term bojjhanga, by 
        &quot;Factors of Enlightenment&quot; (see here Chapter VII). Therefore 
        the title of the treatise in the original translation and the rendering 
        of the term in the body of the text have been changed into 
        &quot;Requisites of Enlightenment&quot;, being one of the connota-tions 
        of bodhipakkhiya-dhamma, as given in Chapter I. This nuance of meaning 
        was chosen in view of the fact that this treatise does not deal with 
        perfected constituents of Enlightenment (bodhi) already achieved, but 
        with the approach to that goal by earnest cultivation of those seven 
        groups of qualities and practices which form the 37 Bodhipakkhiya-dhammas.</font></p>

      Path Attainment</font></p>
      </b>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is stated in the <i>Puggala-Pannatti</i> 
      (the &quot;Book of Classification of Individuals&quot;, 160; <i>Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka)</i> and in the <i>Anguttara Nikàya</i> (The Fours, No. 133) that, 
      of the beings who encounter the <i>Sàsana</i>, i.e. the Teaching of the 
      Buddha, four classes can be distinguished, viz.:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Ugghàtitannu,<br>
        2. Vipancitannu,<br>
        3. Neyya, </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">and<br>
        </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">4. Padaparama.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of' these four classes of 
      beings, an <i>Ugghàtitannu </i>(one who understands immediately) is an 
      individual who encounters a Buddha in person [1] and who is capable of 
      attaining the Paths and the Fruits through the mere hearing of a short 
      concise discourse.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A<i> Vipancitannu </i>is an 
      individual who has not the capability of attaining the Paths and the 
      Fruits through the mere hearing of a short discourse, but who yet is 
      capable of attaining the Paths and the Fruits when the short discourse is 
      expounded to him at some length.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A<i> Neyya </i>is an 
      individual who has not the capability of attaining the Paths and the 
      Fruits through the hearing of a short discourse or when it is expounded to 
      him at some length, but is one for whom it is necessary to study and take 
      careful note of the sermon and the exposition, and then to practise the 
      provisions contained therein for days, months, and years, in order that he 
      may attain the Paths and the Fruits.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This <i>Neyya </i>class of 
      individuals can again be sub-divided into many other classes according to 
      the period of practice which each individual finds necessary before he can 
      attain the Paths and the Fruits, and which further is dependent on the<i> 
      pàramis </i>(Perfections) which each of them has previously acquired, and 
      the <i>kilesas </i>(defilements) which each has surmounted.<i> </i>These 
      classes of individuals include on the one hand those for whom the 
      necessary period of practice is seven days, and on the other, those for 
      whom the necessary period of practice may extend to thirty or sixty years.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Further classes also arise as 
      for example in the case of individuals whose necessary period of practice 
      is seven days; the stage of an Arahant may be attained if effort is made 
      in the first or second period of life [2], while no more than the lower 
      stages of the Paths and the Fruits can be attained if effort be made only 
      in the third period of life.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then, again, putting forth 
      effort for seven days means exerting as much as is in one's power to do 
      so.<i> </i>If the effort is not of the highest order, the period of 
      necessary effort becomes lengthened according to the laxity of the effort, 
      and seven days may become seven years or longer.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the effort during this 
      life is not sufficiently intense as to enable one to attain the Paths and 
      the Fruits, then release from worldly ills cannot be obtained during the 
      present Buddha Sàsana (Dispensation of a Buddha's Teaching) while release 
      during future Buddha Sàsanas can be obtained only if the individual 
      encounters them.<i> </i>No release can be obtained if no Buddha Sàsana is 
      encountered.<i> </i>It is only in the case of individuals who have secured 
      <i>niyata vyàkarana</i> (sure prediction made by a Buddha), that an 
      encounter with a Buddha Sàsana and release from worldly ills is certain.<i> 
      </i>An individual who has not attained &quot;Sure prediction&quot; <i>(niyata</i> 
      <i>vyàkarana) </i>cannot be certain either of encountering a Buddha 
      Sàsana or achieving release from worldly ills, even though he has 
      accumulated sufficient <i>pàramis </i>to make both these achievements 
      possible.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are considerations in 
      respect of those individuals who possess the capabilities of attaining the 
      Paths and the Fruits by putting forth effort for seven days, but who have 
      not obtained &quot;sure prediction&quot;.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Similar considerations apply 
      to the cases of those individuals who have the potentiality of attaining 
      the Paths and the Fruits by putting forth effort for fifteen days, or for 
      longer periods.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A<i> Padaparama </i>is an 
      individual who, though he encounters a Buddha Sàsana, and though he puts 
      forth the utmost possible effort in both the study and practice of the 
      Dhamma, cannot attain the Paths and the Fruits within this lifetime.<i> </i>All 
      that he can do is to accumulate good habits and potentials </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(vàsanà).</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such a person cannot obtain 
      release from worldly ills during this lifetime.<i> </i>If he dies while 
      practising <i>samatha</i> (Tranquillity) or <i>vipassanà </i>(Insight), 
      and attains rebirth either as a human being or a <i>deva </i>in his next 
      existence, he can attain release from worldly ills in that existence 
      within the present Buddha Sàsana.<i> </i>Thus did the Buddha declare with 
      respect to four classes of individuals.</font></p>
      <b>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Three Types of Patients</font></p>
      </b>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the same sources referred 
      to above, the Buddha gave another classification of beings, dividing them 
      into three classes resembling three types of sick persons [3]<b>,</b> 
      namely:</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) A person who is certain 
      of regaining health in due time even though he does not take any medicine 
      or treatment.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) A person who is certain 
      of failing to make a recovery, and dying from the illness, no matter to 
      what extent he may take medicines or treatment.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) A person who will recover 
      if he takes the right medicine and treatment, but who will fail to recover 
      and die if he fails to take the right medicine and treatment.<i> </i>These 
      are the three kinds of sick persons.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Persons who obtained <i>niyata 
      vyàkarana </i>(sure prediction made by a Buddha) from previous Buddhas, 
      and who as such are certain of obtaining release from worldly ills in this 
      life, resemble the first class of sick persons.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A<i> Padaparama </i>class of 
      individual resembles the second class of sick persons.<i> </i>Just as this 
      second class of sick person has no chance of recovery from his illness, a <i>Padaparama</i> 
      class of individual has no chance of obtaining release from worldly ills 
      during this life.<i> </i>In future lives, however, he can obtain release 
      either within the present Buddha Sàsana or within future Buddha Sàsanas.<i> 
      </i>The story of the youth Chattamànava [4], of the frog who became a <i>deva 
      </i>and of the ascetic Saccaka [5] are illustrations of persons who 
      obtained release from worldly ills in their next following existences 
      within the present Buddha Sàsana.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A <i>Neyya </i>class of 
      individual resembles the third class of sick persons.<i> </i>Just as a 
      person of this third class is related to the two ways of either recovering 
      or dying from the sickness, so is a <i>Neyya </i>individual related to the 
      two eventualities of either obtaining release from worldly ills during the 
      present life, or failing to obtain such release.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If such a <i>Neyya </i>individual, 
      knowing what is good for him according to his age, discards what should be 
      discarded, searches for the right teacher, and obtains the right guidance 
      from him and puts forth sufficient effort, he can obtain release from 
      worldly ills in this very life.<i> </i>If, however, he becomes addicted to 
      wrong views and wrong ways of conduct; if he finds himself unable to 
      discard sensual pleasures; if although able to discard sensual pleasures 
      he does not obtain the guidance of a good teacher; if although obtaining 
      the guidance of a good teacher, he is unable to evoke sufficient effort; 
      if although inclined to put forth effort he is unable to do so through old 
      age; if although young he is liable to sickness, he cannot obtain release 
      from worldly ills in this present life.<i> </i>King Ajàtasattu [6] the 
      millionaire Mahàdhana's son [7], Bhikkhu Sudinna [8], are cases of 
      persons who could not have release from worldly ills in this present 
      existence.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">King Ajàtasattu failed to 
      obtain release because he had committed parricide.<i> </i>It is stated 
      that he will drift in future <i>samsàra </i>(round of rebirths) for two <i>asankheyyas 
      </i>(unit followed by 140 ciphers) of world-cycles, after which he will 
      become a<i> paccekabuddha </i>(Solitary Buddha).</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The millionaire Mahàdhana's<i> 
      </i>son indulged himself so excessively in sensual pleasures during his 
      youth that he was unable to attain tranquillity of mind when he grew 
      older.<i> </i>Far from obtaining release from worldly ills, he did not 
      even get the opportunity of associating with the <i>Ti-ratana </i>[9]. 
      Seeing his plight at that stage, the Buddha said to Ànanda: 
      &quot;Ànanda, if this millionaire's son had become a <i>bhikkhu </i>in my 
      <i>sàsana </i>during his youth or first period of his life, he would have 
      become an Arahant and would have attained Parinibbàna [10] in this 
      present life.<i> </i>If, otherwise, he had become a <i>bhikkhu </i>during 
      the second period of his life, he would have become an Anàgàmi [11] and 
      on death would have been reborn in the <i>Suddhàvàsa brahma loka </i>[12],<i> 
      </i>whence he would attain parinibbàna.<i> </i>In the next alternative, 
      if he had become a <i>bhikkhu </i>in my <i>sàsana </i>at the beginning of 
      the third period of life, he would have become either a Sakadàgàmi 
      (Once-Returner) or a Sotàpanna (Stream-enterer) and would have attained 
      permanent release from rebirth in the <i>apàya lokas </i>[13].<i> </i>Thus 
      said the Buddha to the Venerable Ànanda.<i> </i>Thus, although, he (the 
      millionaire Mahàdhana's son) possessed <i>pàrami </i>ripe enough to make 
      his present life his last existence, not being a person who had secured 
      &quot;sure prediction&quot;, <i>niyata vyàkarana, </i>he failed to obtain 
      release from worldly ills in his present life because of the upheavals 
      caused by the defilements within him, and this is despite the fact that he 
      had the opportunity of encountering the Buddha Sàsana.<i> </i>If further 
      his period of existence in the Lower Regions <i>(apàya loka) </i>is 
      prolonged because of evil acts done in this existence, he would not be 
      able to rise again and emerge out of those <i>apàya lokas </i>in time for 
      the <i>sàsana </i>of the future Metteyya Buddha.<i> </i>And, after that, 
      the large number of world cycles that follow are world-cycles where no 
      Buddhas appear,&quot; [14] there being no world-cycles within the vicinity 
      of the present world where Buddhas are due to appear.<i> </i>Alas! far 
      indeed is this millionaire's son from release from worldly ills even 
      though he possessed <i>pàrami </i>(Perfections) ripe enough to make his 
      present existence his last one.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The general opinion current 
      at the present day is that if the <i>pàramis </i>are complete, one cannot 
      miss encountering a Buddha Sàsana even if one does not wish to do so, and 
      that one's release from worldly ills is ensured even though one may not 
      desire such release.<i> </i>These people fail to pay attention to the 
      existence of <i>niyata </i>(i.e., one who has obtained a sure prediction 
      made by a Buddha) and <i>aniyata </i>(one who has not obtained a sure 
      prediction made by a Buddha).<i> </i>Considering the two texts from the <i>Pitakas 
      </i>mentioned above, and the story of the millionaire Mahàdhanas' son, it 
      should be remembered that<i> aniyata neyya </i>individuals can attain 
      release from worldly ills in this life only if they put forth sufficient 
      effort, even if they possess <i>pàramì </i>sufficient to enable them to 
      obtain such release.<i> </i>If industry and effort are lacking, the Paths 
      and the Fruits cannot be attained within the present Buddha Sàsana.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from these classes of 
      persons, there are also an infinite number of other beings who, like the 
      ascetics AÄàra and Uddaka (Majjh. 28), possess sufficient <i>pàrami </i>for 
      release from worldly ills, but who do not get the opportunity because they 
      happen to be in one or the other of the eight inopportune places <i>(atthakkhanas</i>) 
      [15] where it is not possible to attain the Paths and the Fruits thereof.</font></p>
      <b>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Necessary Conditions of

      </i></b>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the four classes of 
      individuals mentioned, the <i>Ugghàtitannù </i>and the <i>Vipancitannù </i>classes 
      can attain the <i>Sotàpattimagga</i> (Path of a Stream-winner) and the 
      other higher stages of wisdom -- like Visàkhà and Anàthapindika [16] 
      through the mere hearing of a discourse.<i> </i>It is not necessary for 
      such individuals to practise the Dhamma according to the stages of 
      Purification, such as Purification of Virtue <i>(sìla-visuddhi), </i>of 
      Consciousness <i>(citta-visuddhi) </i>and so on.<i> </i>Be it remembered 
      that this is also the case when <i>devas </i>and <i>brahmàs </i>attain 
      release from worldly ills.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence it should be noted that 
      the courses of practice such as <i>sìla-visuddhi </i>and<i> 
      citta-visuddhi, </i>laid down in the Pàli Canon, are only for the <i>Neyya 
      </i>and<i> Padaparama </i>classes of individuals before their attainment 
      of the <i>Sotàpattimagga. </i>These courses of practice are also for the 
      first three classes of individuals prior to the achievement of the higher 
      stages of the Paths and the Fruits.<i> </i>In the period after the 
      attainment of Arahantship also, these courses of practice are used for the 
      purpose of<i> dittha-dhamma-sukha-vihàra</i> (dwelling at ease in this 
      present existence) [17] since Arahants have already gone through them.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After the passing of the 
      first thousand years (of the present Buddha Sàsana), which constituted 
      the times of the <i>Patisambhidhà-patta </i>Arahant (Arahant possessing 
      Analy-tical Knowledge), the period of the present Buddha Sàsana comprises 
      the times of the <i>Neyya </i>and<i> Padaparama </i>classes of individuals 
      alone.<i> </i>At the present day, only these two classes of individuals 
      remain.</font></p>

      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Neyya-puggala</font></p>
      </b>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of these two classes of 
      individuals, an individual of the <i>Neyya </i>class can become a 
      Stream-winner <i>(Sotàpanna) </i>in this present life, if he faithfully 
      practises the <i>bodhipakkhiya dhamma </i>comprising<i> satipatthàna </i>(four 
      Foundations of Mindfulness), <i>sammappadhàna </i>(Right Exertion), etc.<i> 
      </i>If he is lax in his practice, he can become a <i>Sotàpanna </i>only 
      in his next existence after being reborn in the <i>deva </i>planes.<i> </i>If 
      he dies while still aloof from these <i>(bodhipakkhiya) </i>Dhammas, such 
      as <i>satipatthàna, </i>etc., he will become a total loss so far as the

      Qualities and Constituent Groups of Existence.<i> </i>Because they are 
      strong in <i>carana </i>they are likely to encounter the next Buddha 
      Sàsana, but because they lack the seeds of <i>vijjà </i>they cannot 
      attain Enlighten-ment, even though they hear the discourse of the next 
      Buddha in person. They are like Làludàyì Thera [26], Upananda Thera 
      [27], the Chabbaggìya bhikkhus [28], and the King of Kosala [29] who all 
      lived during the lifetime of the Omniscient Buddha.<i> </i>Because they 
      were endowed with the previously accumulated Good Conduct<i> (carana) </i>such 
      as almsgiving and morality, they had the opportunity to associate with the 
      Supreme Buddha, but since they lacked previously accumulated Knowledge <i>(vijjà),</i> 
      the discourses of the Buddha which they often heard throughout their

      these persons get the opportunity of meeting and hearing the discourses of 
      the next Buddha they can attain Enlightenment because they possess <i>vijjà, 
      </i>but since they lack <i>carana </i>it would be extremely difficult for 
      them to get the opportunity of meeting the next Buddha.<i> </i>This is so

      the present Buddha Sàsana and the next.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In case these beings wander

      infinite number of existences and rebirths, and an opportunity to meet the 
      next Buddha can be secured only if all these rebirths are confined to the 
      Happy Course of Existence.<i> </i>If, in the interim, a rebirth occurs in 
      one of the Four Lower Regions, the opportunity to meet the next Buddha 
      would be irretrievably lost, for one rebirth in one of the Four Lower 
      Worlds is often followed by an infinite number of rebirths in one or other 
      of them.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those persons whose acts of <i>dàna

      thus are deficient in <i>carana </i>(Conduct), possess a strong tendency 
      to be reborn in the Four Lower Worlds when they die.<i> </i>If through 
      some good fortune they manage to be reborn in the Happy Course of 
      Existence, wherever they may be reborn they are, because of their previous 
      lack of <i>carana</i> such as <i>dàna, </i>likely to be deficient in 
      riches, and likely to meet with hardships, trials, and tribulations in 
      their means of livelihood, and thus encounter tendencies to rebirth in the<i> 
      apàya lokas. </i>Because of their lack of the <i>carana </i>of <i>nicca</i> 
      <i>sìla </i>and<i> uposatha sìla, </i>they are likely to meet with 
      disputes, quarrels, anger and hatred in their dealings with other persons, 
      in addition to being susceptible to diseases and ailments, and thus 
      encounter tendencies towards rebirth in the <i>apàya</i> <i>lokas. </i>Thus 
      will they encounter painful experiences in every existence, gathering 
      undesirable tendencies, leading to the curtailment of their period of 
      existence in<b> </b>the Happy Course of Existence and causing rebirth in

      lacks the seeds of <i>carana </i>such as <i>dàna </i>and<i> sìla, </i>one 
      will fail to secure the opportunity of meeting the next Buddha Sàsana.<i>

      those <i>Padaparama</i> individuals of today, be they men or women, who 
      look forward to meeting the next Buddha Sàsana, should attempt to 
      accumulate within the present Buddha Sàsana the seeds of <i>carana </i>by 
      the practice of <i>dàna, sìla </i>and<i> samatha bhàvanà</i> (Practice 
      of Tranquillity), and should also, at the least, with respect to <i>vijjà,

      Teaching of Higher Morality), <i>adhicitta sàsana </i>(The Teaching of 
      Higher Mentality), and<i> adhipannà sàsana </i>(The Teaching of Higher

      enables them to attain the Paths and the Fruits.<i> </i>If these persons 
      can add the refinement of<i> uposatha sìla </i>over <i>nicca sìla, </i>it

      faithfully kept.<i> </i>If because they are <i>puthujjanas</i> 
      (worldlings) they break the <i>sìla, </i>it can be re-established 
      immediately by renewing the undertaking to keep the <i>sìla</i> for the 
      rest of their lives.<i> </i>If, on a future occasion, the <i>sìla </i>is 
      again broken, it can again be similarly cleansed, and every time this 
      cleansing occurs, the person concerned again becomes endowed with <i>sìla. 
      </i>The effort is not difficult.<i> </i>Whenever <i>nicca sìla </i>is 
      broken, it should be immediately re-established.<i> </i>In these days,
