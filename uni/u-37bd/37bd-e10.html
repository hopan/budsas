        dwelling place, and medicines.<i> </i>The Dhamma heritage are the three 
        Trainings <i>(sikkhà: sìla, samàdhi, pannà), </i>the seven 
        Purifications, and the thirty-seven Requisites of Enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of 
        Dhamma Heritage, namely mundane <i>(lokiya) </i>and supramundane <i>(lokuttara). 
        </i>The mundane one consists of the above three Trainings on the mundane 
        level, the six mundane Purifications and the Requisites of Enlightenment 
        as far as associated with those mundane Purifications. -- The 
        supramundane Dhamma heritage consists of the three Trainings on the 
        supra-mundane level, the supramundane seventh Purification, and the 
        supramundane Requisites of Enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mundane Dhamma Heritage may

        and property, or towards the attainment of rebirth as noble and highly 
        placed humans and devas, -- this is called &quot;Dhamma heritage 
        dependent on the round of rebirths&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are three forms of 
        the Round of Rebirth: the Round of Defilements <i>(kilesa-vatta), </i>the 
        Round of Kamma <i>(kamma-vatta), </i>and the Round of Kamma Resultants <i>(vipaka-vatta). 
        Vivatta </i>means Nibbàna which is the end of these three Rounds of 
        Rebirths.<i> </i>The practice of Morality, Concentration and Wisdom 
        directed towards the ending of these Rounds of Rebirths is called 
        &quot;Dhamma heritage tending towards the ending of the Round of

        classification of &quot;stable&quot; <i>(niyata)</i> and 
        &quot;unstable&quot; <i>(aniyata), </i>the great realm of 
        &quot;proclivity towards Personality Belief&quot; <i>(sakkàya-ditthi 
        anusaya) </i>in which Worldlings <i>(puthujjana) </i>are involved, is 
        like a great and deep ocean of burning hot embers.<i> </i>The Morality, 
        Concentration and Wisdom occasionally practised by Worldlings can be 
        compared to droplets of rain falling into that great ocean of burning 
        hot embers.<i> </i>Such utterances as &quot;I fulfil <i>sìla</i>,<i> </i>I<i> 
        </i>possess <i>sìla. </i>I practice <i>samàdhi. </i>I<i> </i>know.<i> </i>I 
        am wise and clever.<i> </i>I perceive Mind and Matter <i>(nàma-rùpa). </i>I<i> 
        </i>contemplate Mind and Matter&quot; are declarations about Morality, 
        Concentration and Wisdom, which revolve around the Personality-Belief 
        which is concerned with &quot;I&quot;, and thus resemble the rain drops 
        falling into the great ocean of red-hot embers.<i> </i>Just as the heat 
        of those embers absorbs the rain drops and makes them disappear, so does 
        the great kingdom of Personality-Belief absorb the Worldling's acts of 
        Morality, Concentration and Wisdom and makes them disappear as they are 
        &quot;unstable&quot; <i>(aniyata). </i>Though Worldlings may possess 
        Morality, Concentration and Wisdom, their possession of them is 
        temporary </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(tadanga).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of Sotàpannas, 
        their mundane Morality of keeping the mundane &quot;Precepts with Right 
        Livelihood as the eighth<i>&quot; (lokiya-àjivatthamaka-sìla); </i>their 
        mundane Concentration firmly directed to the noble Qualities of the 
        Triple Gem; and their mundane Wisdom perceiving the Four Noble Truths -- 
        all these are of the rank of stability <i>(niyata). </i>They are like 
        rain drops falling into a great lake and never disappear even throughout 
        many lives.<i> </i>This shows the nature of the mundane <i>(lokiya) </i>Dhamma 
        heritage.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The supramundane states of 
        Morality, Concentration and Wisdom, the supramundane seventh 
        Purification and the 37 Requisites of Enlightenment <i>(bodhipakkhiya 
        dhamma)</i> accompanying the eight kinds of supramundane consciousness 
        are <i>vivatta-nissita </i>and are stable.<i> </i>Also the mundane 
        Morality etc., in the case of Noble Ones <i>(ariya) </i>who also have 
        attained their supramundane state, are likewise &quot;stable&quot;.<i> </i>In 
        such persons, there is no longer any possibility of their becoming <i>dussìla 
        </i>(immoral),<i> asamàhita </i>(uncomposed)<i>, duppanna </i>(unwise) 
        or <i>andhabàla </i>(foolish).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">... Persons who lack Faith <i>(saddhà) 
        </i>and Zeal <i>(chanda)</i> do not even conceive the idea that the 
        higher attainments of the Purifications are the heritage which they can 
        acquire in this very life.<i> </i>Because they lack Energy <i>(viriya), </i>they 
        are reluctant to put forth effort that involves privations.<i> </i>They 
        are liable to reject such effort as impossible.<i> </i>Because they are 
        weak of will,<b> </b>their minds are not fixed on such kind of work.</font><i></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They change their mind 
        whenever they listen to various theories and expositions.<i> </i>Because 
        they lack knowledge and wisdom, they reject such work as being beyond 
        their capabilities.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the Buddha has 
        urged all beings to strengthen their weak <i>Iddhipàdas </i>(Bases of 
        Success), such as Zeal <i>(chanda)</i> etc.<i> </i>Then only can new 
        desires and new thoughts arise.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Only those who possess one 
        or other of the four Iddhipàdas as foundation can enjoy the full 
        benefits of the Buddha's heritage.<i> </i>Others who are without any of 
        these Iddhipàdas, will get the opportunity to enjoy only some of the 
        superficial benefits, without the chance of enjoying the essence of the 
        heritage.<i> </i>Some may not even have the opportunity to enjoy those 
        superficial benefits because they have squandered their heritage and 
        thus become severed from the Buddha's and the Sàsana’s heritages.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The heirs of the Sàsana

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Stable or constant 
          heirs <i>(niyata)<br>
          </i>2. Unstable or inconstant heirs </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(aniyata).</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">People who never obtained 
        knowledge of Impermanence and Not-self within themselves, are called 
        unstable heirs.<i> </i>They may be disciples or heirs of the Buddha 
        today and may become disciples or heirs of another teacher to-morrow.<i> 
        </i>They may scorn and harm the Buddha Sàsana.<i> </i>Even in the 
        present world there are persons who have changed their faith from the 
        Buddha Sàsana to other religions, and who scorn and undermine the 
        Sàsana.<i> </i>How easily they can change, after death, in another 
        birth, can be imagined.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One can be a disciple of 
        the Buddha this month and the disciple of another teacher next month.<i> 
        </i>One can be a disciple of the Buddha this year and the disciple of 
        another teacher next year.<i> </i>One can be a disciple of the Buddha 
        this life and the disciple of another teacher in the next.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore it was said that 
        Puthujjanas (Worldlings) are so called because they look up to the faces 
        of various teachers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This means that, in the 
        unfathomable past Samsàra, Worldlings have never been constant in the 
        choice of a teacher in whom they have taken refuge.<i> </i>The occasions 
        on which they have approached a Buddha and taken refuge in him, are very 
        few indeed.<i> </i>Sometimes they took refuge in Brahmà, sometimes in<i> 
        </i>Sakka (Indra), sometimes in various deities, sometimes in planets, 
        spirits and ogres, and they have done so as if these &quot;refuges&quot; 
        were almighty.<i> </i>The number of false teachers is very numerous in 
        the world, and so is the number of existences in which Worldlings have 
        taken refuge in such false teachers.<i> </i>While worldlings continue to 
        wander and drift in Samsàra, replete with false attachments to 
        Personality Belief, they will continue to change their teachers.<i> </i>How 
        frightful, terrible and repellent is the state of a Worldling!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever a<b> </b>Worldling 
        changes his teacher and refuge, a change alsooccurs in the doctrines and 
        principles on which he dependsfor his guidance.<i> </i>Sometimes 
        World-lings accept the Purified morality <i>(adhisìla) </i>of a Buddha, 
        but more often the moral of numerous other teachers.<i> </i>Also in the 
        matter of views, the existences in which they accept Right View are 
        extremely few, while the lives in which they depend on wrong views are 
        extremely numerous.<i> </i>Of the countless errors and perversities 
        possessed by Worldlings, that of seeking refuge in false teachers is one 
        of the gravest errors causing them great harm.</font><i></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is because taking 
        refuge in wrong teachers leads to wrong Moral principles and practices, 
        and thus the precious and rare achievement of rebirth as a human being<i> 
        (manussatta-dullabha) </i>becomes entirely like a tree producing the 
        evil fruits of rebirth in the worlds of misery, instead of being like a 
        great Wishing Tree bearing the fruits of good rebirths.<i> </i>This 
        shows the future path of unstable heirs of the Sàsana.</font><i></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But those persons who 
        perceive in themselves the characteristics of impermanence <i>(anicca) </i>and 
        not-self <i>(anattà), </i>are freed from the realm of Personality 
        Belief.<i> </i>They become heirs of the Sàsana.<i> </i>&quot;Stable&quot; 
        <i>(niyata) </i>means here that throughout their future lives in 
        Samsàra they are no longer inclined to seek refuge in false teachers.<i> 
        </i>They become true children and heirs of the Buddha throughout the 
        future succession of their rebirths.<i> </i>They become members of the <i>&quot;Bon-sin-san&quot; 
        </i>family (see Note 1, page 55).<i> </i>Their views of the incomparable 
        qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha become clearer and 
        brighter from one rebirth to another.<i> </i>All the Dhamma heritages 
        will prosper and increase in their minds, i.e. the three Path categories 
        (Morality, etc.), the seven<i> </i>Purifications and the thirty-seven 
        Requisites of Enlightenment.<i> </i>They are beings who will invariably 
        ascend to <i>Anupàdisesa-Nibbàna, </i>the Extinction of Defilements 
        without any Groups of Existence remaining.<i> </i>This shows the 
        undeviating path of stable heirs of the Sàsana.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Good and virtuous persons 
        did not put forth effort in past existences because they desired to 
        become heirs of bad heritages of the Sàsana. They did not practice 
        Morality, Concentration and Wisdom, because they desired to become heirs 
        of the unstable temporary heritages, but because they wished to become 
        heirs of the stable heritages.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Taking these facts into 
        account, and taking heed of the fact that the Buddha disapproved of the 
        bad heritages of the Sàsana, those persons who have now become 
        disciples of the Buddha should not permit themselves to become bad 
        heirs, nor to become temporary, unstable heirs.<i> </i>They should 
        attempt to become heirs of the good heritages which are the Requisites 
        of Enlightenment, the Bodhipakkhiya-dhammas.<i> </i>They should attempt 
        to become stable heirs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As regards persons 
        deficient in wisdom, the mere performance of good and meritorious acts 
        has to be encouraged as beneficial.<i> </i>But as to those persons who 
        possess wisdom, if they desire to become stable heirs either in this 
        life or the next, then they should establish in themselves firmly <i>Àjìvatthamaka-sìla 
        </i>(see Note 2, page 12), set up mindful Body Contemplation <i>(kàyagatà 
        sati) </i>and try (for at least three hours a day) to achieve perception 
        of the three Characteristics of Existence in the five aggregates of 
        &quot;personality&quot;. If they perceive any of the three 
        Characteristics, they can become &quot;stable&quot; <i>(niyata)</i> 
        heirs and attain to the status of a <i>&quot;Bon-sin-san&quot; -- </i>Streamwinner.</font></p>
