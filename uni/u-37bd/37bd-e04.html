        perfection (success or potency) [4].</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are four kinds of <i>iddhipàdas.

        <blockquote>

          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">By <i>chanda </i>is meant 
        (the zeal or) desire to obtain, desire to attain, desire to reach, 
        desire to fulfil, desire to accomplish.<i> </i>The desire indicated here 
        is extreme or excessive desire.<i> </i>There is nothing within or 
        without one's personality that can obstruct that desire.<i> </i>It is 
        the kind of desire that evokes the thought, &quot;If I do not attain 
        this accomplishment in this life, I shall not rest content.<i> </i>It is 
        better that I die rather than that I shall not attain it.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is the kind of desire 
        nurtured by King Dhammasonda [5] of Benares during the time of the 
        Kassapa Buddha [6], when the king said to himself, &quot;What use is 
        there in my being king of Benares if I do not get the opportunity of 
        hearing a discourse of the Kassapa Buddha?&quot; The king, therefore, 
        relinquished his throne and went out in search of one who could repeat 
        to him a discourse of the Kassapa Buddha, no matter though that 
        discourse consisted of a short stanza only.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such desire is appeased if 
        it is fulfilled, as in the case of King Bimbisàra [7], Visàkha, and 
        Anàthapindika [8]. See Dhammapada Com., story relating to Verse 1.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is only when there are 
        faint indications that the desire can be attained but is not fulfilled, 
        that the mind becomes troubled, and thoughts arise that it is better to 
        die than live without attaining the desire.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Examples of such desire 
        existed also in King Temiya [9] , King Hatthipàla [10], and kings, 
        nobles, and rich men in the time of the Buddha who discarded their 
        palaces, retinue and other luxuries to live the lives of Bhikkhus in the 
        Buddha Sàsana.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Viriya </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">(Energy) 
        means <i>sammappadhàna viriya </i>together with its four 
        characteristics (see Chapter II).<i> </i>A person with this <i>viriya </i>is 
        infused with the thought that the aim can be attained by energy and 
        effort.<i> </i>He is not discouraged even though it is said to him that 
        he must undergo great hardships.<i> </i>He is not discouraged even 
        though he actually has to undergo great hardships.<i> </i>He is not 
        discouraged even though it is said to him that he must put forth effort 
        for many days, months, and<b> </b>years.<i> </i>He is not discouraged 
        even though he actually has to put forth effort for such long periods.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who are weak in 
        energy recoil from their task when confronted with work requiring great 
        energy and effort.<i> </i>They shrink when told that they will have to 
        stay apart from friends and associates.<i> </i>They shrink from the 
        prospect of the necessity to be frugal in sleep and food.<i> </i>They 
        shrink from the prospect of long periods of concentration.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Citta </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">(lit.: 
        consciousness) means: attachment to <i>iddhis</i> when one comes in 
        contact with the Sàsana and hears the Dhamma.<i> </i>It is attachment 
        that is extremely ardent and strong.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although one lives amidst 
        the beauties and luxuries of the world, amidst acquired powers and 
        fortunes, amidst the sacred books and the study of them, one is not 
        allured, but one's mind is always turned towards the <i>iddhis. </i>One 
        attains satisfaction and tranquillity only when one's mind is absorbed 
        in matters connected with the <i>iddhis. </i>It is like the absorption 
        of the alchemist engaged in the transmutation of the baser metals into 
        gold or silver.<i> </i>Such an alchemist has no interest in anything 
        else but his alchemy.<i> </i>He forgets to sleep or eat, or whether he 
        had slept or eaten.<i> </i>He does not notice anything when out walking.<i> 
        Citta </i>is great absorption, or attachment of this nature.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Vimamsà </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">(investigation) 
        means: knowledge or wisdom that can clearly perceive the greatness of 
        the sufferings of hell, and of the sufferings attendant on the round of 
        rebirths.<i> </i>It is knowledge that can clearly perceive the 
        advantages and benefits of the <i>iddhis. </i>It is knowledge that can 
        dwell on the deep and difficult <i>dhammas, </i>and on their nature.<i> </i>A 
        person who possesses such knowledge can no longer find pleasure in any 
        worldly pursuit except the pursuit of the <i>iddhis. </i>He finds 
        gratification only in the acquisition of deep and profound <i>iddhis. </i>The 
        deeper and more profound the <i>dhammas, </i>the greater is his desire 
        to attain them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who are endowed with 
        any one of these four Bases of Success <i>(iddhipàda) </i>can no 
        longer, during this life, admit or plead inability and remain without 
        putting forth effort in the establishment of Body Contemplation <i>(kàyagatàsati) 
        </i>and the higher stages of the Sàsana such as, the seven 
        Purifications <i>(visuddhi). </i>It is only those who have never 
        possessed any one of these Bases of Success, and who cannot 
        differentiate between the shallowness and profoundness of life, between 
        superficiality and depth of the <i>dhamma, </i>who admit or plead 
        inability and remain without making any endeavour.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A person endowed with any 
        one of these four <i>iddhipàdas</i> can attain, according to his <i>pàrami, 
        </i>the<i> iddhis </i>until he reaches <i>lokultara </i>(supramundane)<i> 
        iddhi, </i>either in this life or as a <i>deva </i>in the next life.<i> </i>The 
        cases of those endowed with two, or three, or four <i>iddhipàdas </i>need 
        no lengthy explanation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In<b> </b>the cases of 
        those persons who (far from possessing any of the <i>iddhis) </i>do not 
        even possess any of the <i>iddhipàdas,</i> they should attempt to 
        acquire one or other of these Bases.<i> </i>They admit or plead 
        inability only because they have not the desire to acquire the higher 
        benefits of the Sàsana, such as the <i>satipatthànas. </i>They should 
        regard this very admission of inability as a highway to the Lower Worlds 
        of Misery <i>(Apàya-loka). </i>Thus, they should study, think and 
        ponder, over the Suttanta discourses that can arouse zeal <i>(chanda). </i>They 
        should approach a teacher who can arouse zeal and rely on him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence did the Buddha say:</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Chandiddhipàdam bhàveti, 
        Viriyiddhipàdam bhàveti,</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Cittiddhipàdam 
        bhàveti, Vimamsiddhipàdam bhàveti.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(He cultivates zeal, 
        energy, consciousness and invegtigation as the Bases of Success.&quot;)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some persons, far from 
        attaining the <i>iddhis, </i>do not even try to attain the <i>iddhipàdas. 
        </i>If they do not possess <i>chanda, </i>they do not even know that it 
        is necessary to acquire such Zeal <i>(chanda). </i>They are persons who 
        admit and plead inability and defeat.<i> </i>The same is true in the 
        cases of <i>viriya,</i> <i>citta, </i>and </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">vimamsa.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Steady application of the 
        mind to <i>kàyagatàsati </i>amounts to setting up <i>pàda. </i>Studying 
        the anecdotes conveying a sense of urgency <i>(samvega) </i>[11],<i> </i>applying 
        oneself to the strict ascetic observances <i>(dhutanga) </i>and such 
        other practices of the <i>dhamma, </i>is setting up of energy <i>(viriya). 
        </i>Applying oneself to profound subjects of Dhamma, such as the Four 
        Great Primaries (or Elements; <i>mahà-bhùta) </i>amounts to the 
        setting up of <i>vimamsa </i>(Investigation).</font><i></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If any one of the four 
        Bases of Success is established, then it is certain that the respective <i>iddhis 
        </i>[12] will be attained according to one's Pàrami.<i> </i>Hence, it 
        is stated in the Commentaries that persons who do not possess any of the 
        Bases of Success, resemble the sons of a Candàla (a man of low class), 
        while persons possessing one of the Bases of Success resemble the sons 
        of an Emperor.<i> </i>The sons of a Candàla never even aim at becoming 
        an Emperor because they have no basis, no <i>pàda, </i>for such an 
        attainment.<i> </i>Sons of Emperors, however, always aim at becoming 
        Emperors because they are endowed with the bases for attaining such an 
        aim.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, wise persons of the 
        present day should attempt to acquire the four <i>Iddhipàdas, </i>the 
        Bases of Success, so that they can destroy the great realm of 
        Personality Belief <i>(sakkàya-ditthi), </i>and acquire, within the 
        Sàsana, the benefits of the higher attainments that can be obtained 
        according to one's Pàramis.</font></p>
