      <P>Meditate Right Now</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you fail to meditate on the rising 
      phenomena and so do not know their real nature of impermanency, suffering 
      and not-self, you may relive them and thus let defilements be. This is a 
      case of latent defilements. Because they arise from objects, we call them 
      &quot;object-latent.&quot; What do people cling to and why do they cling to? They 
      cling to things or persons they have seen because they have seen. If you 
      fail to meditate on them as they arise, somehow or other grasping arise. 
      Defilements are latent in whatever we see, hear, taste, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you<B> </B>meditate, you find that what 
      you see passes away, what you hear passes away. They pass away in no time 
      at all. Once you see them as they really are, there is nothing to love, 
      nothing to hate, nothing to cling to. If there is nothing to cling to, 
      there can be no clinging or grasping.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And you meditate right now. The moment you 
      see, you meditate. You can&#39;t put it off. You may buy things on credit, but 
      you cannot meditate on credit. Meditate right now. Only then will the 
      clingings not come up. Scripturally speaking, you meditate as soon as the 
      eye-door process ends and before the subsequent mind-door process begins. 
      When you see a visible object, the process takes place like this: First, 
      you see the object that comes up. This is the seeing process. Then you 
      review the object seen. This is the reviewing process. Then you put the 
      forms seen together and see the shape or material. This is the form 
      process. Last of all, you know the concept of name. This is the name 
      process. With objects you have never seen before, and so you do not know 
      the names of this, naming process will not occur. Of the four, when the 
      first or seeing process takes place, you see the present form, the 
      reality, as it rises. When the second or reviewing process takes place, 
      you review the past form, the form seen -- reality again. Both attend on 
      reality -- the object seen. No concept yet. The difference is between the 
      present reality and the past reality. With the third process you come to 
      the concept of shape. With the fourth you come to the concept of names. 
      The processes that follow are all various concepts. All these are common 
      to people not practised in insight meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are 14 thought-moments in the 
      process of seeing. If neither seeing, hearing, nor thinking conscious-ness 
      arises, life-continuum goes on. It is identical with 
      rebirth-consciousness. It is the consciousness that goes on when you are 
      sleeping fast. When a visible object or any such appears, life-continuum 
      is arrested, and seeing consciousness, etc., arises. As soon as 
      life-continuum ceases, a thought-moment arises adverting the 
      conscious-ness to the object that comes into the avenue of the eye. When 
      this ceases, seeing consciousness arises. When this again ceases, the 
      receiving consciousness arises. Then comes the investigating 
      consciousness. Then, the conscious-ness that determines whether the object 
      seen is good or not. Then, in accordance with the determination reached, 
      moral or immoral apperceptions arise violently for seven thought-moment. 
      When these cease, two retentive resultants arise. Whenthese cease, there 
      comes subsidence into life-continuum like falling asleep. From the 
      adverting to retention there are 14 thought-moments. All these manifest as 
      one seeing consciousness. This is how the seeing process takes place. When 
      one is well-practised in insight meditation, after the arising of 
      life-continuum following the seeing process, insight consciousness that 
      reviews &quot;seeing&quot; takes place. You must try to be able to thus meditate 
      immediately. If you are able to do so, it appears in your intellect as 
      though you were meditating on things as<B> </B>they are seen, as they just 
      arise. This kind of meditation is termed in the Suttas as &quot;meditation on 
      the present.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Understanding in reviewing the perversion 
      of present states is knowledge in arising and passing away.&quot; -- </FONT>
      </I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Patisambhidamagga</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These extracts from the Suttas clearly 
      show that we must meditate on present states. If you fail to meditate on 
      the present, apprehending arises from life-continuum. This consciousness 
      arises to review what has just been seen. The thought-moments included 
      are: apprehending conscious-ness, apperceptions 7, and registering 
      consciousness 2 -- a total of 10 thought-moments. Every time you think or 
      ponder, these three types of consciousness and ten thought-moments take 
      place. But to the meditator they will appear as one thought-moment only. 
      This is in conformity with the explanations in connection with the 
      knowledge of dissolution in Patisambhida-magga and Visuddhi-magga. If<I>
      </I>you can meditate beyond the apprehending, you may not get to concepts 
      and may stay with the reality -- the object seen. But this is not very 
      easy for the beginner.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you fail to meditate even at the 
      apprehending, you get to form process and name process. Then graspings 
      come in. If<I> </I>you meditate after the emergence of graspings, they 
      will not disappear. That is why we instruct you to meditate immediately, 
      before the concepts arise.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The processes for hearing, smelling, 
      tasting, touching, are to be understood along similar lines.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With thinking at the mind-door, if you 
      fail to meditate immediately, subsequent processes come up after the 
      thought. So, you meditate immediately so that they may</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">not arise. Sometimes, as you are noting &quot;<I>rising, 
      falling, sitting, touching&quot; </I>a thought or idea may come up in between. 
      You notice it the moment it arises. You note it and it ends right there. 
      Sometimes a wandering of the mind is about to arise. You note it and it 
      quiets down. In the words of some meditators, &quot;it is like a naughty child 
      who behaves himself when shouted at &#39;Quiet!&#39; &quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, if you note the moment you see, hear, 
      touch, or perceive, no subsequent consciousness will arise to bring about 
      graspings.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;.... you will simply have the sight of 
      the thing seen, the sound of the thing heard, the sense of the things 
      sensed, and the idea of the thing cognized.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As this extract from Malunkya-sutta shows, 
      the mere sight, the mere sound, the mere sense, the mere idea is there. 
      Recall them and only the real nature you have understood will appear. No 
      graspings. The meditator who meditates on whatever arises as it arises 
      sees how everything arises and passes away, and it becomes clear to him 
      how everything is impermanent, suffering, not self. He knows this for 
      himself -- not because a teacher has explained it to him. This only is the 
      real knowledge.</FONT></P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>Incessant Work</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To arrive at this knowledge needs thorough 
      work. There is no guaranteeing that you<B> </B>will gain such knowledge at 
      one sitting. Perhaps one in a million will. In the days of the Buddha 
      there are people who attained to the Path and Fruit after listening to a 
      stanza. But you can&#39;t expect such things today. It was then the Buddha 
      himself who was teaching. He knew the disposition of his listeners very 
      well. The listeners on their part were people of perfections. But today 
      the preacher is just an ordinary person who preaches what little he has 
      learnt. He does not know the disposition of his listeners. It will be 
      difficult to say that the listeners are men and women of perfections. If 
      they had been, they would have gained deliverance in the days of the 
      Buddha. So we cannot guarantee you will gain special knowledge at one 
      sitting. We can only tell you that you can if you work hard enough.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How long do we have to work? Understanding 
      impermanence, suffering and not self begins with the investigating 
      knowledge. But it does not come at once. It is preceded by purity of mind, 
      purity of views, and purity of transcending doubts. To speak from the 
      level of the present-day-meditators, a specially gifted person can achieve 
      this knowledge in two or three days. Most will take five, six, or seven 
      days. But they must work assiduously. Those who get slack at work may not 
      gain it even after fifteen or twenty days have passed. So I will talk 
      about working in earnest in the beginning.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Insight meditation is incessant work -- 
      meditate whenever you see, hear, smell, taste<B>, </B>touch or think, 
      without missing any thing. But to beginners, to note everything is quite 
      impossible. Begin with several. It is easy to observe the moving form in 
      the rising and falling of the abdomen. We have already spoken about it. 
      Note without a let-up <I>rising, falling, rising, falling. </I>As your 
      mindfulness and concentration grow stronger, add the sitting and the 
      touching and note</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> rising, falling, 
      sitting, touching. </FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As you note on, ideas may come up. Note 
      them, too:<I> thinking, planning, knowing. </I>They are hindrances. Unless 
      you are rid of them, you have not got purity of mind and will not have a 
      clear understanding of mind-matter phenomena. So, don&#39;t let them in. Note 
      them and get rid of them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If unbearable feelings like tiredness, 
      hotness, pain, or itch, appear in the body, concentrate on them and note:
      <I>tired, tired </I>or<I> hot, hot </I>as they arise. If the desire arises 
      to stretch or bend the limbs, note it too, <I>desire to bend, desire to 
      stretch. </I>When you bend or stretch, every move should be noted: <I>
      bending, bending, stretching, stretching. </I>In the same way, when you 
      rise, note every move. When you walk, note every step. When you sit down, 
      note it. If you lie down, note it too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Every bodily movement made, every thought 
      that arises, every feeling that comes up, all must be noted. If there is 
      nothing in particular to note, go on noting <I>rising, falling, sitting, 
      touching. </I>You must note while eating or having a bath. If there are 
      things you see or hear particularly, note them too. Except for the 
      four-five-six hours you sleep, you keep noting things. You must try to be 
      able to note at least one thing in a second.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you keep on noting thus in earnest, you 
      will, in two or three days, find your mindfulness and concentration quite 
      strong. If not in two or three days, in five or six. Then, very rarely do 
      wanton thoughts come up. If they do, you are able to note them the moment 
      they come. And they pass away the moment you notice them. The object noted 
      like the rising and falling and the mind noting it seem to be well-timed. 
      You note with ease. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These are signs that your mindfulness and 
      concentration have become strong. In other words, you have developed 
      purity of mind.</FONT></P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>Things Fall Apart</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">From now on, every time you note, the 
      object noted and the mind that notes it appear two separate things. You 
      come to know that the material form like the rising and falling is one 
      thing and the mental state that notes it is another. Ordinarily, the 
      material form and the mind that cognizes it do not seem separate. They 
      seem one and the same thing. Your book knowledge tells you they are 
      separate but your personal feeling has them as one. Shake your index 
      finger<B>.</B> Do you see the mind that intends to shake? Can you 
      distinguish between that mind and the shaking? If you are sincere, the 
      answer will be No. But to the meditator whose mindfulness and 
      concentration are well developed the object of attention and the awareness 
      of it are as separate as the wall and the stone that is thrown to it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha used the simile of the gem and 
      the thread (D.i.72). Just as when you look at a string of lapis lazuli you 
      know: the gem is threaded on a string; this is the gem, this is the string 
      the gem is threaded on, so does the meditator know: this is the material 
      form, this is the consciousness that is aware of it, which depends on it, 
      and is related to it. The Commentary says that the conscious-ness here is 
      the insight consciousness, insight knowledge, that observesthe material 
      form. The lapis lazuli is the material form and the string is the 
      consciousness that observes. The thread is in the gem as the insight 
      awareness penetrates the material form.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you note <I>rising, </I>the rising is 
      one thing, the awareness is one thing -- only these two exist. When you 
      note <I>falling </I>the falling is one, the awareness is one -- only these 
      two. The knowledge comes clear to you of its own accord. When you lift one 
      foot in walking, one is the lifting, the other is the awareness -- only 
      these two exist. When you push it forward, the pushing and the awareness. 
      When you put it down, the putting down and the awareness. Matter and 
      awareness. These two only. Nothing else.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As your concentration improves further, 
      you unders-tand how the material and mental things you have been noting 
      keep passing away each in its own time. When you note <I>rising, </I>the 
      form rising comes up gradually and passes away. When you note falling, the 
      form falling comes up gradually and then passes away. You also find that 
      the rising as well as the awareness passes away, the falling as well as 
      the awareness passes away. With every noting you find only arising and 
      passing away. When noting <I>bending, </I>one bending and the next do not 
      get mixed up. Bends, passes away, bends, passes away -- and thus, the 
      intention to bend, the form bending, and the awareness, come and go each 
      in its time and place. And when you note the tiredness, hotness, and pain, 
      these pass away as you are noting them. It becomes clear to you: they 
      appear and then disappear, so they are impermanent.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditator understands for himself what 
      the commentaries say, &quot;They are impermanent in the sense of being nothing 
      after becoming.&quot; This knowledge comes to him not from books nor from 
      teachers. He understands by himself. This is real knowledge. To believe 
      what other people say is faith. To remember out of faith is learning. It 
      is not knowledge. You must know from your own experience. This is the 
      important thing. Insight meditation is contemplation in order to know for 
      yourself. You meditate, see for yourself, and know -- this alone is 
      insight.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Regarding contemplation on impermanence 
      the commentary says:</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;.... the impermanent should be 
      understood.&quot; <BR>
      &quot;.... impermanence should be understood.&quot;<BR>
      &quot;.... the discernment of the impermanent should be understood.&quot; -- </FONT>
      </I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Visuddhi-magga, i 281</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This brief statement is followed by the 
      explanation: &quot;Here, &#39;impermanent&#39; are the Five Aggregates.&quot; You must know 
      that the five aggregates are impermanent. Although you may not understand 
      it by your own knowledge, you should know this much. Not only that. You 
      should know that they are all suffering, all without a self. If you know 
      this much, you can take up insight meditation. This understanding made by 
      learning is given in</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">

      Majjhima Nikaya i 318</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To &quot;understand&quot; means to meditate on the 
      mind-and-matter and be aware of it. It is the basic insight knowledge of 
      Analytical Knowledge of Mind and Matter and the knowledge by Discerning 
      Conditionality. So, if you have learnt that mind and matter are all 
      impermanent, suffering and not-self, you can begin meditating from the 
      analysis of mind and matter. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then you can go on to higher knowledges 
      like the Investigating knowledge.</FONT></P>

      comprehends all of them&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, the least qualification required of a 
      beginner in insight meditation is that he must have heard or learnt of the 
      impermanent, suffering, and not-self nature of mind and matter. To 
      Buddhists in Burma this is something they have had since childhood.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We say mind and matter are impermanent 
      because they come to be and then pass away. If a thing never comes to be, 
      we cannot say it is impermanent. What is that thing which never comes to 
      be? It is a concept.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Concepts never come to be, never really 
      exist. Take a personal name. It comes<I> </I>into use from the day a child 
      is named. It appears as though it has come to be. But actually people just 
      say it in calling him. It has never come to be, it never really exists. If 
      you think it exists, find it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When a child is born, the parents give it 
      a name. Suppose a boy has been named &quot;Master Red.&quot; Before the naming 
      ceremony the name Master Red is unknown at all. But from the day the boy 
      is named people begin calling him Master Red. But we can&#39;t say the name 
      has come into being since then. The name Master Red just does not exist. 
      Let&#39;s find it out.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Is the name Master Red in his body? On his 
      head? On his side? On his face? No, it is not anywhere. The people have 
      agreed to call him Master Red and that is all. If he dies<I>, </I>does the 
      name die with him too? No. As long as the people do not forget it, the 
      name will live on. So it is said, &quot;a name or surname never gets 
      destroyed&quot;. Only when the people forget it will the name Mastcr Red 
      disappear. But it is not destroyed. Should someone restore it, it will 
      come up again.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Think of the Bodhisatta&#39;s names in the 
      Jatakas: Vessantara, Mahosadha, Mahajanaka, Vidhura, Temiya, Nemi... these 
      names were known in the times of the stories but were lost for millions of 
      years until the Buddha restored them. Four <I>asankkeyyas </I>and a 
      hundred thousand <I>kalpas</I> ago the name Dipankara the Buddha and the 
      name Sumedha the recluse were well known. They were lost to posterity 
      afterwards. But our Buddha restored them and the names are known to us 
      again. They will be known as long as the Buddha&#39;s teaching lasts. Once 
      Buddhism is gone from earth these names will be forgotten too. But if a 
      future Buddha were to speak about them again, they would become known 
      again. So, concepts, names, are just conventions. They never exist. They 
      have never been and they will never be. They never arise, so we can&#39;t say 
      they &quot;pass away.&quot; Nor can we say they are impermanent. Every concept is 
      like that -- no existence, no becoming, no passing away, so no 
      impermanence. Nibbana, although it is a reality, cannot be said to be 
      impermanent because it never comes to be or passes away. It is to be 
      regarded is permanent because it stands as peace for ever.</FONT></P>

      <P>Impermanence</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Realities other than Nibbana -- mind and 
      matter -- never were in the beginning. They come into being whenever there 
      arise causes. After coming into being they pass away. So we say these 
      realities of mind and matter are impermanent. Take seeing, for example. In 
      the beginning there was no seeing. But if the eye is good, the object 
      comes up, there is light, your attention is drawn to it -- if these four 
      causes concur, then there is seeing. Once it has risen, it passes away. No 
      more of it. So we say seeing is impermanent. It is not very easy for an 
      ordinary person to know that seeing is impermanent<B>. </B>Hearing is 
      easier to understand. There was no hearing in the beginning. But if the 
      ear is good, the sound comes up, there is no barrier, your attention is 
      drawn to it -- if these four factors concur, then there is hearing. It 
      arises and then passes away. No more of it. So we say hearing is 
      impermanent.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now you hear me talking. You hear one 
      sound after another. Once you have heard them, they are gone. Listen, <I>
      sound, sound,</I> <I>sound. </I>When I say so<I>, </I>you hear it, then it 
      is no more. When I say <I>sound, </I>you hear it, then it is gone. That is 
      how they come and pass away. The same is true of other psycho-physical 
      phenomena. They come and go. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, 
      thinking, bending, stretching, moving -- all come and go away. Because 
      they keep passing away, we say they are impermanent.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Of these, the passing away of 
      consciousness is very clear. If your mind wanders while you are noting <I>
      rising,</I> <I>falling, </I>you note <I>wandering. </I>As you note it, the 
      wandering mind is no more. It is gone. It has not existed before. It comes 
      about just then. Then it is gone in no time at all when noted. So we say 
      it is impermanent. The passing away of unpleasant feelings too, is 
      obvious. As you go on noting <I>rising, falling, </I>tiredness, hotness, 
      or pain, appears somewhere in the body. If you concentrate on it and note
      <I>tiredness, tiredness,</I> etc., sometimes it disappears completely, and 
      sometimes it disappears at least for the time you are noting. So it is 
      impermanent. The meditator realizes its impermanent characteristic as he 
      notes its arising<B> </B>and passing away.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This realization of the fleeting nature of 
      things is Contemplation of Impermanence. It comes from your own 
      experience. Mere reflection without personally experiencing it is no true 
      knowledge. Without meditating you will not know what things come up and 
      what things pass away. It is just book learning. It may be a meritorious 
      deed, but not real insight knowledge.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Real insight knowledge is what you know 
      for yourself by meditating on things as they come up and pass away. Here 
      in the audience are lots of meditators who have come to this stage of 
      knowledge. I am not speaking from my own experience alone. No, not even 
      from the experience of forty or fifty disciples of mine. There are 
      hundreds of them. Beginners may not have such clear knowledge yet. It is 
      not quite easy. But it is not too difficult to achieve, either. If you 
      work hard enough as we instruct, you can have it. If you don&#39;t, you can&#39;t. 
      Educational degrees, distinctions, honours -- all are results of hard 
      work. No pain, no gain. The insight knowledge of the Buddha, too, must be 
      worked for.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As your concentration grows sharper, you 
      will be able to see a great number of thoughts in one single act of 
      bending or stretching of the limbs. You will see large numbers of thoughts 
      coming up one after another as you intend to bend or stretch. The same 
      number when you step. There arise a great number of thoughts in the 
      twinkling of an eye. You have to note all these fleeting thoughts as they 
      arise. If you cannot name them, just note <I>&quot;aware, aware.&quot;</I> You will 
      see that there are four,<I> </I>five, or ten thousands arising in 
      succession every time you note <I>aware. </I>Sometimes when the awareness 
      is so swift, even the word <I>aware </I>is<I> </I>no longer necessary. 
      Just following them with your intellect will do.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now a thought arises, now the mind is 
      aware of it; now another thought arises, now the observant conscious-ness 
      is aware of it. It is like the saying &quot;a morsel of food, a stroke of the 
      stick.&quot; For every thought that arises there is the observant consciousness 
      to be aware of it. Thus aware, these arisings and passings away are made 
      only too plain to you. The wandering mind that arises as<B> </B>you are 
      noting the rising and falling of the abdomen is caught by the observing 
      consciousness as an animal that falls direct into the snare or an object 
      that is hit by a well-aimed stone. And once, you are aware of it, it is 
      gone. You find it as clearly as if you were holding it in your hand. You 
      find thus whenever consciousness arises.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When tiredness arises, you note <I>tired,</I> 
      and it is gone. It comes up again, you note it again, and it is gone 
      again. This kind of passing away will be made all the more clearer in 
      higher insight. Tired, noted, gone; tired, noted, gone -- they pass away 
      one by one. There is no connection between one tiredness and the next. The 
      same with pain. Pained, noted, gone; pained, noted, gone -- each pain is 
      gone at each noting. One pain does not mix with the other. Each pain is 
      distinct from the other.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To ordinary people there is no 
      interruption in tiredness or pain. It seems to tire or pain you 
      continuously for a long time. In fact, there is no tiredness or pain for a 
      long while. One tiredness and the next, one pain and the next, just very 
      short pieces, very separate ones. The meditator sees this as he notes.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you note <I>rising, </I>the rising 
      comes up gradually and passes away by degrees. When you note <I>falling,
      </I>the falling comes up and passes away by degrees. Common people who are 
      ignorant of this fact think of the rising and falling in terms of the 
      absurd abdominal shape. So from their own experience they think the 
      meditators too, will only be seeing the absurd abdominal shape. Some make 
      accusations to this effect. Don&#39;t speak by guess, please. Try and see for 
      yourselves, let us warn. If you work hard enough, you will find out.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you note <I>bending, </I>you see 
      clearly how it moves and passes, moves and passes, one moves after 
      another. You understand now the scriptural statement that realities like 
      mind and matter do not move from place to place. Ordinary people think it 
      is the same hand that moves, that has been before the bending, and that 
      will be after the bending. They think the same hand moves inwards and 
      outwards. To them it is ever-unchanging hand. It is because they have 
      failed to see through the continuity of matter, the way matter rises in 
      succession. It is because they lack in the knowledge to see through. 
      Impermanence is hidden by continuity, it is said. It is hidden because one 
      does not meditate on what arises and passes away. Says </FONT><I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Visuddhi-magga:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Because the rise and fall are not

      in broken pieces so continuity cannot hide the fact from him. The

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How will you take what you very well know 
      to be capable of rising and passing away to be self, ego, a being? People 
      cling to the self because they think they have been the same person the 
      whole life. Once it is clear to you from your own experience that life is 
      but made up of things that rise and pass away incessantly, you will not 
      cling as self. Some obstinate persons say that this sutta is meant for 
      Meghiya alone. This is something that should not be said. We fear others 
      will come up who will say what the Buddha said were meant for the people 
      of his days, not for us who live today. But the statement is found not in 
      that sutta alone. In Sambodhi sutta<I> </I>the Buddha says:</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;To one, monks, who has perceived 
      impermanence the perception of not-self is established.&quot; -- </FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Anguttara Nikaya iii, 165</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And, if one realizes impermanence, one 
      realizes suffering, too. The meditator who realizes how things are rising 
      and passing away, can see how the two events, rising and passing away, 
      have been oppressing him. The commentary to Sambodhi sutta says:</FONT></P>

      <P>Rediscovery</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this connection let me tell you a story 
      from my own experience as a<B> </B>preacher. It is about a meditator from 
      my native village Hseipkhun in Shwebo district. He was none<B> </B>other 
      than a cousin of mine. He was one of the first three persons to take up 
      insight meditation in the village. The three of them agreed among 
      themselves to work for a week first. They worked very hard. They had 
      brought to the hermitage cigars and betel quids to be taken one each day. 
      But when they returned from the hermitage they took home all the seven 
      cigars and betel quids -- untouched.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So hard did they work that in three days 
      they attained the knowledge of rising and falling and were overjoyed to 
      experience tranquillity and see brilliance around. &quot;Only at this old age 
      have we discovered the truth,&quot; they spoke with great joy. Because they 
      were the first to take up meditation I thought of letting them go with 
      their joys and just told them to go on noting. I did not tell them not to 
      note the joys. So, although they worked for four more days, they did not 
      get any higher.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After a few days&#39;rest they came again for 
      another week of meditation. That cousin of mine then reached the stage of 
      the knowledge of dissolution. Although he was noting <I>rising, falling, 
      sitting, </I>he<I> </I>did not see the abdominal shape, and his body 
      seemed to have disappeared, so he had to touch it with his hand to see if 
      it was still there, he told me. And, whenever he looked or saw, everything 
      seemed to be dissolving and breaking up. The ground he looked at was 
      dissolving and so were the trees. It was all against what he had thought 
      things to be. He began to wonder.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He had never thought such external, 
      season-produced, gross material things like earth, trees, logs, etc, could 
      be incessantly breaking up. He had thought they perished only after 
      aconsiderable length of time. They lasted for quite a long time, he 
      thought. Now, as insight knowledge gained momentum with meditation the 
      rising and passing away of phenomena appeared to him of their own accord 
      without his specially meditating on them. They were passing away, breaking 
      up, there before him. It was all the reverse of his former beliefs. 
      Perhaps his new vision was wrong. Perhaps his eye-sight was failing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So he asked me. And I told him. The 
      passing away and breaking up he saw in everything were true. As your 
      insight grew sharper and quicker, things appear rising and passing away to 
      you without your meditating on them. These are all true, I explained to 
      him. Later on he again told me about his own findings as h<B>e </B>
      progressed in insight. Today he is no more. He has long been dead.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When insight knowledge has grown really 
      sharp, it will prevail over wrong beliefs and thoughts. You see things in 
      their true light as impermanent, suffering, not-self. An uncultured mind 
      or reflection without meditation cannot give you real insight into the 
      nature of things. Only insight meditation can do that. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once you realize impermanence, you see how 
      they oppress you with their rising and passing away, how you can derive no 
      pleasure from them, how they can never be a refuge, how they can perish 
      any moment, so how they are frightening, how they are sufferings, etc.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;... ill (suffering) in the sense of 
      fearful.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You thought, &quot;This body will not perish so 
      soon. It will last for quite a long time.&quot; So you took it for a great 
      refuge. But now as you meditate you find only incessant risings and 
      passings-away. If no new ones rise up for the mental and material things 
      that have passed away, one dies. And this can happen any moment. To make a 
      self out of these mental and material things that can die any moment and 
      to take refuge in it is as dreadful a thing as sheltering in an old 
      tumble-down house.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And you find that nothing happens as you 
      desire. Things just follow their natural course. You thought you could go 
      if you wished to, sit if you wished to, rise, see, hear, do anything if 
      you wished to. Now as you meditate you find that it is not so. Mind and 
      matter are found to be working in a pair. Only when there is intention to 
      bend is there the<B> </B>form bending. Only when there is intention to 
      stretch is there the form stretching. There is effect only when there is 
      cause. Only when there is something to see do you see. If there is 
      something to see, you can&#39;t help seeing it. You hear, when there is 
      something to hear. You feel happy only when there is reason to be happy. 
      You worry when there is cause to worry. If there is cause, there is 
      effect. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You cannot help it. There is no thing that 
      lives and does what it desires. There is no self, no ego, no I. Only 
      processes of arising and passing away.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To understand clearly is the most 
      important thing in insight meditation. Of course, you will come across 
      joys, tranquillities, bright lights in the course of your training. They 
      are not important things. What is important is to understand impermanence, 
      suffering and not-self. These characteristics are made clear to you as you 
      just keep on meditating as explained.</FONT></P>

      themselves as impermanent. There is nothing to cling to. They oppress us 
      with their rise and fall. They are all sufferings. There is nothing to 
      cling to as happy, good, or beautiful. They rise and fall as is their 
      nature, so there is nothing to cling to as self, soul, or I, that lives

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To get to the Aryan Path one starts with 
      insight path. And insight path begins with the analytical knowledge of 
      mind and matter. Then one arrives at the knowledge by discerning 
      conditionality. Then, working on, one gains the knowledge of 
      investigation. Here one comes to enjoy reflecting on things, investigating 
      them, and persons of considerable learning often spend a long time doing 
      so. If you do not want to reflect or investigate, you just keep on 
      meditating. Your awareness now becomes light and swift. You see very 
      clearly how the things noted arise and pass away. You have come to the 
      knowledge of rising and passing away.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At this stage noting tends to be easy. 
      Illuminations, joys, tranquillities appear. Going through experiences 
      unthought of before, one is thrilled with joy and happiness. At the 
      initial stage of his work, the meditator has had to take great pains not 
      to let the mind wander this way and that. But it has wandered and for most 
      of the time he has not been able to meditate. Nothing has seemed all 
      right. Some have had to fight back very hard indeed. But with strong faith 
      in one&#39;s teachers, good intentions and determination, one has passed all 
      these difficult stages. One has now come to the knowledge of rising and 
      passing away. Everything is fine at this stage. Noting is easy and 
      effortless. It is good to note, and brilliant lights appear. Rapture 
      seizes him and causes a sort of goose-flesh in him. Both body and mind are 
      at ease and he feels very comfortable. The objects to be noted seem to 
      drop on one&#39;s mindfulness of their own accord. Mindfulness on its part 
      seems to drop on the object of its own accord. Everything is there already 
      noted. One never fails or forgets to note. On every noting the awareness 
      is very clear. If you attend to something and reflect on it, it proves to 
      be a plain and simple matter. If you take up impermanence, suffering and 
      not-self, about which you have heard before, they turn out to be plainly 
      discernible things. So you feel like preaching. You think you would make a 
      very good preacher. But if you have had no education, you will make a poor 
      preacher. But you feel like preaching and you can even become quite 
      talkative. This is what is called &quot;the ideal Nibbana&quot; the meditators 
      experience. It is not the real Nibbana of the Aryans. We may call it 
      &quot;imitation Nibbana.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;It is the immortality of the knowers.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Training in meditation is like climbing a 
      mountain. You begin climbing from the base. Soon you get tired. You ask 
      people who are coming down and they answer you with encouraging words like 
      &quot;It&#39;s nearer now.&quot; Tired, you climb on and very soon come to a resting 
      place in the shade of a tree with a cool breeze blowing in. All your 
      tiredness is gone. The beautiful scenery around fascinates you. You get 
      refreshed for a further climb. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The knowledge of the rising and passing 
      away is the resting place for you on your climb to higher insight 
      knowledge.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Those meditators who have not yet reached 
      this stage of knowledge may be losing hope. Days have passed and no taste 
      of insight yet. They often get disheartened. Some leave the meditation 
      centre with thoughts that meditation is nothing after all. They have not 
      discovered the &quot;meditator&#39;s Nibbana.&quot; So we instructors have to encourage 
      newcomers to the centre with the hope that they will attain to this 
      knowledge at least. And we ask them to work to attain to it soon. Most 
      succeed as we advise. Then they needn&#39;t further encouragement. They are 
      now full of faith and determination to work on till the ultimate goal.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This &quot;meditator&#39;s Nibbana&quot; is often spoken 
      of as<I> amanusi rati -</I>- non-human delight or superhuman enjoy-ment. 
      You derive all kinds of delights from various things -- from education, 
      wealth, family life. The &quot;meditator&#39;s Nibbana&quot; surpasses all these 
      delights. A meditator once told me that he had indulged in all kinds of 
      worldly pleasures. But none could match the pleasure he derived from 
      meditation. He just could not express how delightful it was.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But is that all? No, you must work on. You 
      go on with your noting. Then, as you progress, forms and features no 
      longer manifest themselves and you find them always disappearing. Whatever 
      appears disappears the moment you notice it. You note seeing, it 
      disappears swiftly. You note hearing, it disappears. Bending, stretching, 
      again it disappears swiftly. Not only the object that comes up, the 
      awareness of it too disappears with it in a pairwise sequence. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is the knowledge of dissolution.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Every time you note, they dissolve 
      swiftly. Having witnessed this for a long time, you become frightened of 
      them. It is the knowledge of the Fearful. Then you find fault with these 
      things that keep passing away. It is the knowledge of tribulation. Then as 
      you meditate on, you get wearied of them. It is the knowledge of 
      repulsion.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;So seeing all these things, the 
      instructed disciple of the aryans disregards the material shapes, 
      disregards feeling.&quot; -- </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Majjhima 
      Nikaya i, 137; Samyutta Nikaya iii, 68</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Your material body has been a delightful 
      thing before. Sitting or rising, going or coming, bending or stretching, 
      speaking or working, everything has seemed very nice<B>. </B>You have 
      thought this material body of yours to be a dependable and delightful 
      thing. Now that you have meditated on it and seen<B> </B>that everything 
      dissolves, you no longer see your body as dependable. It is no longer 
      delightful. It is just a dull, tiresome business.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You have enjoyed both pleasurable feelings 
      of the body and mental pleasure. You have thought, &quot;I am enjoying,&quot; &quot;I<I>
      </I>feel happy.&quot; Now these feelings are no longer pleasurable. They, too, 
      pass away as you notice them. You become wearied of them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You have thought well of your perception. 
      But now it too, passes away as you notice it. You feel disgusted with it 
      as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Volitional activities are responsible for 
      all your bodily, mental and vocal behaviours. To think, &quot;I sit, I rise, I 
      go, I act,&quot; is to cling to volitional activities. You have thought well of 
      them, too. Now that you see them<B> </B>passing away, you feel repulsion 
      for them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You have<B> </B>enjoyed thinking. When 
      newcomers to the meditation centre are told that they must not engage in 
      thinking about things, but must keep noting, they are not at all pleased. 
      Now you see how thoughts, ideas, come up and pass away, and you are tired 
      of them, too. The same thing happens to your sense organs. Whatever comes 
      up at the six doors is now a thing to disgust, to be wearied of. Some feel 
      extreme<B> </B>disgust, some a considerable amount.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then arise desires<B> </B>to be rid of 
      them all. Once you are tired of them, of course you want to get rid of 
      them. &quot;They come and pass incessantly. They are no good. It were well if 
      they all<B> </B>ceased.&quot; This is the knowledge of desire for deliverance. 
      Where &quot;they all ceased&quot; is Nibbana. To desire for deliverance from them is 
      to long for Nibbana. What must one do if he wants Nibbana? He works harder 
      and goes on meditating. This is the knowledge of reflection. Working with 
      special effort, the characteristics of impermanence, suffering and 
      not-self become all the more clearer to you. Especially clearer is 
      suffering.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After reflection you come to the knowledge 
      of indifference to formations. Now the meditator is quite at ease. Without 
      much effort on his part the notings run smoothly and are very good. He 
      sits down to meditate and makes the initial effort. Then everything runs 
      its course like a clock once wound up goes on ticking of its own accord. 
      For an hour or so he makes no change in his posture and goes on with his 
      work without interruption. Before this knowledge there may have been 
      disturbances. Your mind may be directed to a sound heard and thus 
      disturbed. Your thoughts may wander off and meditation is disturbed. 
      Painful feelings like tiredness, hotness, aches, itches, coughs, appear 
      and disturb you. Then you have to start it all over again. But now all 
      goes well. There are no more disturbances. Sounds you may hear but you 
      ignore them and go on noting. Whatever comes up you note without being 
      disturbed. There are no more wanderings of the mind. Pleasant objects may 
      turn up but no delight or pleasure arises in you. You meet with unpleasant 
      objects. Again you feel no displeasure or fear. Painful feelings like 
      tiredness, hotness or aches rarely appear. If they do, they are not 
      unbearable. Your noting gets the better of them. Itching pains and coughs 
      disappear once you attain this knowledge. Some even get cured of serious 
      illnesses. Even if the illnesses are not completely cured, you get some 
      relief while noting in earnest. So for an hour or so there will be no 
      interruption to your notings. Some can go on meditating for two or three 
      hours without interruption. And yet you feel no weariness in<B> </B>body. 
      Time passes unheeded. &quot;It&#39;s not long yet,&quot; you think. On such a<B> </B>hot 
      summer day as this it would be very fine to have attained this knowledge<B>.
      </B>While other people are groaning under the intense heat the meditator 
      who is working in earnest with this knowledge will not be aware of the 
      heat at all. The whole day seems to have fled in no time. It is a very 
      good insight knowledge indeed, yet there can be dangers like excess of 
      worry ambition, or attachment. If these cannot be removed, no progress 
      will be made. Once they are removed, the aryan path knowledge is there to 
      realize. How?</FONT></P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>Noble Path</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Every time you note <I>rising, falling,</I>
      <I>sitting, touching, seeing, hearing, bending, stretching,</I> and so on, 
      there is an effort being made. This is the right effort of the Noble 
      Eightfold Path. Then there is your mindfulness. It is right mindfulness. 
      Then there is concentration which penetrates the object noted as well as 
      remains fixed on it. This is right concentration. The three are called 
      Concentration Constituents of the Path. Then there is initial application 
      which, together with concentration, ascends on the object noted. It is the 
      application of the concomitants on the object. Its characteristic is 
      &quot;lifting&quot; of the concomitants to the object (abhiniropanalakkhana), 
      according to the Commentary. This is right thought. Then there is the 
      realization that the object thus attended is movement, non-cognition, 
      seeing, cognition, impermanence and so on. This is right view. Right 
      thought and right view together form the Wisdom Constituent of the Path. 
      The three Morality Constituents, right speech, right action and right 
      livelihood, have been perfected before you take up insight meditation -- 
      when you take the precepts. Besides, there can be no wrong speech, no 
      wrong action, or no wrong livelihood in respect of the object noted. So 
      whenever you note, you perfect the Morality Constituents of the Path as 
      well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The eight constituents of the Noble Path 
      are there in every awareness. They constitute the insight path that comes 
      up once clinging is done away with. You have to prepare this path 
      gradually until you reach the knowledge of indifference to formations. 
      When this knowledge grows mature and strong, you arrive at Aryan Path in 
      due course. It is like this:-- When the knowledge of indifference to 
      formations has matured and grown stronger, your notings get sharper and 
      swifter. While thus noting and becoming aware swiftly, all of a sudden you 
      fall into the peace that is Nibbana. It is rather strange. You have no 
      prior knowledge of it. You cannot reflect on it on arrival, either. Only 
      after the arrival can you reflect. You reflect because you find unusual 
      things. This is the knowledge of reflection. Then you know what has 
      happened. This is how you realize Nibbana through the Aryan Path.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, if you want to realize Nibbana, what 
      is important is to work for freedom from clingings. With ordinary people 
      clingings arise everywhere: in seeing, in hearing, in touching, in being 
      aware. They cling to things as being permanent, as being happy, good, as 
      soul, ego, persons. We must work for a complete freedom from these 
      clingings. To work is to meditate on whatever rises, whatever is seen, 
      heard, touched, thought of. If you keep meditating thus, clingings cease 
      to be, the Aryan Path arises, leading to Nibbana. This is the process.</FONT></P>
