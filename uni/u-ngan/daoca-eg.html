        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">INTRODUCTION</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Phra Ajaan Mun Bhùridatto 
        Mahàthera (1870-1949) was by all accounts the most highly respected 
        Buddhist monk in recent Thai history. Ordained in 1893, he spent the 
        major part of his life wandering through Thailand, Burma, and Laos, 
        dwelling for the most part in the forest, engaged in the practice of 
        meditation. He attracted a large following of students and -- together 
        with his teacher, Phra Ajaan Sao Kantasìla Mahàthera -- was 
        responsible for the establishment of the forest ascetic tradition that 
        has now spread throughout Thailand and to several countries abroad.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Despite his fame as a 
        teacher, very few of his teachings were recorded for posterity. Only one 
        slim book of passages drawn from his sermons, <i>Muttodaya </i>(A Heart 
        Released), was published during his lifetime. His students generally 
        believed that he himself never wrote down any of his teachings, but at 
        his death the following poem was found among the few papers he left 
        behind. As he noted on the final page, he composed it during one of his 
        brief stays in Bangkok, at Wat Srapatum (Lotus-Pond Monastery), probably 
        in the early 1930's. He was apparently inspired by an anonymous poem on 
        the theme of meditation composed and printed in Bangkok during that 
        period, for both poems share virtually the same beginning -- the 39 
        lines in the following translation beginning with, &quot;Once there was 
        a man who loved himself .....&quot; Ajaan Mun's poem, however, then 
        develops in an entirely original direction and shows by far a deeper 
        understanding of the training of the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Translating the poem has 
        presented a number of difficulties, not the least of which has been 
        getting a definitive reading of the original manuscript. Ajaan Mun wrote 
        during the days before Thai spelling became standardized, some of the 
        passages were smudged with age, and a few seem to have been 
        &quot;corrected&quot; by a later hand. Another difficulty has been the 
        more general problem of finding the proper English style for translating 
        Thai poetry, which depends heavily on rhyme, rhythm, and a stripped- 
        down syntax, somewhat like that of telegrams and newspaper headlines. 
        This style gives Thai poetry a lightness of style combined with a 
        richness of meaning, but frustrates any attempt to pin down any one 
        precise message for the sake of translation -- an excellent lesson for 
        anyone who feels that the truth is what is conveyed in words.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The following translation 
        is meant to be as literal as possible, although I have fleshed the text 
        out when it seemed necessary to make the English intelligible. Because 
        the original alternates between two poetic forms -- <i>klon</i> and <i>rai</i> 
        -- I tried to create a similar effect in English by alternating blank 
        verse and free verse. The result is probably too literal to be poetry, 
        but I felt that anyone reading it would be more interested in the 
        meaning than in verbal effects. The instances where I have taken the 
        most liberty with the text have been included in square brackets, as has 
        one passage ironically, dealing with the error of being addicted to 
        correcting things-where the reading of the original seems to have been 
        doctored.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The reader will notice that 
        in a few places the poem seems to jump abruptly from one topic to 
        another. In some cases these shifts were dictated by the rhyme scheme, 
        but in others they are not really shifts at all. Keep in mind that the 
        poem operates on several levels. In particular, two parallel themes run 
        throughout: (1) an analysis of the external error of focusing on the 
        faults of other people instead of one's own,, and (2) a discussion of 
        the mind's<b> </b>internal error of viewing (and criticizing) the <i>khandhas</i> 
        as somehow separate from its own efforts to know them. Statements made 
        directly about one level apply indirectly to the other as well. Thus the 
        poem covers a wider range of the practice than might appear at first 
        glance. It's a work that rewards repeated readings.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to express my 
        gratitude to Phra Ajaan Suwat Suvaco (Phra Bodhidhammacariya Thera) for 
        the invaluable help he gave me in untangling some of the knottier 
        passages in the poem. Any mistakes that may remain, of course, are mine.</font></p>

              <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a man 
              who loved himself<br>
              and feared distress. He wanted happiness<br>
              beyond the reach of danger, so he wandered<br>
              endlessly. Wherever people said<br>
              that happiness was found, he longed to go,<br>
              but wandering took a long, long time.<br>
              He was the sort of man who loved himself<br>
              and really dreaded death. He truly wanted<br>
              release from aging and mortality.<br>
              Then one day he came to know the truth,<br>
              abandoning the cause of suffering and<br>
              compounded things. He found a cave of wonders,<br>
              of endless happiness, i.e., the body.<br>
              As he gazed throughout the cave of wonders,<br>
              his suffering was destroyed, his fears appeased.<br>
              He gazed and gazed around the mountain side,<br>
              Experiencing unbounded peace.</font></p>
              <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He feared if he were 
              to go and tell his friends,<br>
              they'd say he'd gone insane. He'd better stay<br>
              alone, engaged in peace, abandoning<br>
              his thoughts of contact, than to roam around,<br>
              a sycophant, both criticized and flattered,<br>
              exasperated and annoyed.</font></p>
              <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But then there was 
              another man afraid<br>
              of death, his heart all withered and discouraged.<br>
              He came to me and spoke frankly<br>
              in a pitiful way. He said,<br>
              &quot;You've made an effort at your meditation<br>
              for a long time now.<br>
              Have you seen it yet,<br>
              the true Dhamma of your dreams?&quot;<br>
              (Eh! How is it that he knows my mind?)<br>
              He asked to stay with me, so I agreed.<br>
              &quot;I'll take you to a massive mountain<br>
              with a cave of wonders<br>
              free from suffering and stress:<br>

              You can view it at your leisure to cool your heart<br>
              and end your troubles.<br>

              Get the heart to look again and again<br>
              at its inconstancy, until it's a habit.<br>
              When you reach &quot;Oh!&quot;<br>
              it will come on its own:<br>
              awareness of the heart's song,<br>
              like a mirage.<br>
              The Buddha says the corruptions of insight<br>
              disguise themselves as true<br>
              when actually they're not.<br>
              The awareness of mental phenomena<br>
              that comes on its own,<br>
              is direct vision,<br>
              not like hearing and understanding<br>
              on the level of questioning.<br>
              The analysis of phenomena,<br>
              mental and physical,<br>
              is also not vision that comes on its own:<br>
              so look.<br>
              The awareness that comes on its own<br>
              is not the thought-song.<br>
              Knowing the mind-source<br>
              and mind-moments,<br>
              the source-mind is released from sorrow.<br>
              The mind-source's certain<br>
              automatic knowledge of <i>sankhàras</i><br>
              -- the affairs of change --<br>
              is not a matter of parading out<br>
              to see or know a thing.<br>
              It's also not a knowledge based<br>
              on labeling in pairs.<br>
              The mind knows itself<br>
              from the motion of the song.<br>
              The mind's knowledge of the motion<br>
              is simply adjacent mind-moments.<br>
              In fact, they can't be divided:<br>
              They're all one and the same.<br>
              When the mind is two, that's called<br>
              <i>sannà</i> entangling things.<br>
              Inconstancy is itself, so why focus on anyone else?</font></p>
              <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When the heart 
              sees its own decayings,<br>
              it's released from darkness.<br>
              It loses its taste for them,<br>
              and abandons its doubts.<br>
              It stops searching for things within and without.<br>
              Its attachments all fall away.<br>
              It leaves its loves and hates,<br>
              whatever weighs it down.<br>
              It can end its desires,<br>
              its sorrows all vanish --<br>
              together with the weighty cares<br>
              that made it moan --<br>
              as if a shower of rain were to refresh the heart.<br>
              The cool heart is realized by the heart itself.<br>
              The heart is cool for it has no need<br>
              to wander around, looking at people.<br>
              Knowing the mind-source in the present,<br>
              it's unshakeable and unconcerned<br>
              with any good or evil,<br>
              for they must pass away,<br>
              with all other impediments.<br>
              Perfectly still, the mind-source<br>
              neither thinks nor interprets.<br>
              It stays only with its own affairs:<br>
              no expectations,<br>
              no need to be entangled or troubled,<br>
              no need to keep up its guard.<br>
              Sitting or lying down, one thinks<br>
              at the source-mind: 'Released.' &quot;</font></p>
