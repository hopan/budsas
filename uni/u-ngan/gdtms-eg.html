      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This treatise explains the progress of 
      Insight [1], together with the corresponding stages of Purification [2].<B>
      </B>It has been written in brief for the benefit of meditators who have 
      obtained distinctive results in their practice, so that they may more 
      easily understand their experience. It is meant for those who, in their 
      practice of Insight, have taken up as their main subject either the 
      tactile bodily process of motion [3], evident in the rising and falling 
      movement of the abdomen [4], or the tactile bodily process based on three 
      of the primary elements of matter [5] evident in the sensation of touch 
      (bodily impact). It is meant for those who, by attending to these 
      exercises, have gained progressive Insight as well, into the whole 
      body-and-mind process arising at the six sense-doors [6], and finally come 
      to see the Dhamma, attain to the Dhamma, understand the Dhamma, penetrate 
      the Dhamma, pass beyond doubt, free themselves from uncertainty, obtain 
      assurance, and achieve independence of others in the Master&#39;s dispensation 
      [7].</FONT></P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>I. PURIFICATION OF CONDUCT</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Purification of Conduct means here, in the 
      case of male and female devotees (Upàsakas and Upàsikas), the acceptance 
      of the Precepts, and the proper guarding and protecting of their 
      observance, -- whether it be the five precepts, the eight Uposatha 
      precepts, or the ten precepts [8].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the case of Bhikkhus, Purification of 
      Conduct is the well-kept purity of the fourfold conduct incumbent upon 
      monks, beginning with Restraint according to the Disciplinary Rules of 
      Bhikkhus, called Pàtimokkha. Of that fourfold conduct, the Restraint 
      according to the Pàtimokkha Rules is of first importance; because only 
      when that Restraint is pure, will one be able to accomplish the 
      development of meditation [9].</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Method of Insight in brief</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of 
      Meditation-development, viz Tranquillity <I>(samatha) </I>and Insight <I>
      (vipassanà). </I>A person who, of these two, has first developed 
      Tranquillity, and after having established himself in either Access 
      Concentration or Full Concentration [10], subsequently contemplates the 
      five Groups of Grasping [11], is called a <I>Samatha-yànika</I>, i.e. one 
      who has Tranquillity as his vehicle.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">About his method of attaining Insight, the 
      Papancasudanì, commenting on the Dhammadàyàda Sutta of the Majjhima 
      Nikàya, says, &quot;Herein, a certain person first produces Access 
      Concentration or Full Concentration; this is Tranquillity. He then applies 
      Insight to that Concentra-tion and to the mental states associated with 
      it, seeing them as impermanent, etc.; this is Insight.&quot; In the Visuddhi 
      Magga, too, it is said; &quot;He whose vehicle is Tranquillity should first 
      emerge from any fine-material or immaterial Jhàna, except the base 
      consisting of Neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and he should then 
      discern, according to characteristic, function, etc., the Jhàna-factors 
      consisting of applied thought, etc., and the mental states associated with 
      them&quot; (&#39;Path of Purification&#39;, ch. XVIII, 3).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He, however, who has neither produced 
      Access Concentration nor Full Concentration, but from the very start 
      applies Insight to the five Groups of Grasping, is called <I>
      Suddha-vipassanà-yànika </I>[12]<I>, </I>i.e. one who has pure Insight as 
      his vehicle. About his method of attaining Insight it is said in the same 
      Commentary to the Dhammadàyàda Sutta, &quot;There is another person, who, even 
      without having produced the aforesaid Tranquillity, applies Insight to the 
      five Groups of Grasping, seeing them as impermanent, etc.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Visuddhi-magga, too, it is said thus: 
      &quot;One who has pure Insight as his vehicle... contemplates the four 
      elements.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the Susìma-paribbàjaka Sutta of the 
      Nidànavagga Samyutta, too, it is said by the Buddha: &quot;First arises the 
      knowledge comprehending the actual happening of things <I>
      (dhamma-tthiti-nàna) </I>and afterwards arises the knowledge realising 
      Nibbàna </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(nibbàne nàna).&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When Purification of Conduct has been 
      established, the meditator who has chosen pure Insight as his vehicle, 
      should endeavour to contemplate the <I>Body-and-Mind (nàma-rùpa). </I>In 
      doing so, he should contemplate, according to their characteristics [13], 
      the five Groups of Grasping, i e. the bodily and mental processes that 
      become evident to him in his own life-continuity (at his own six 
      sense-doors) [14].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Insight must, in fact, be developed by 
      noticing [15], according to their specific and general characteristics 
      [16], the bodily and mental processes that become evident at the six 
      sense-doors. At the beginning, however, it is difficult to follow and to 
      notice clearly all bodily and mental processes that incessantly appear at 
      the six sense-doors. Therefore the meditator who is a beginner, should 
      first notice the<B> </B>perfectly distinct process of touch, perceived 
      through the door of bodily sensitivity; because the Visuddhi Magga says 
      that, in Insight meditation, one should take up what is distinct. When 
      sitting, there occurs the bodily process of touch by way of the sitting 
      posture and through touch sensitivity in the body. These processes of 
      tactile sensitivity should be noticed as &quot;Sitting ... touching ...&quot;, and 
      so forth, in due succession. Further, at the sedant meditator&#39;s abdomen, 
      the tactile process of bodily motion (i.e., the wind, or vibratory, 
      element) which has breathing as its condition, is perceptible continuously 
      as the rise (expansion) and fall (contraction) of the abdomen. That also, 
      should be noticed as &quot;rising ... falling&quot;, and so forth. While the 
      meditator is thus engaged in noticing the element of motion which impinges 
      continuously on the door of bodily sensitivity in the abdomen, it becomes 
      evident to him in its aspects of stiffening, of vibrating, and of pushing 
      and pulling. Here, the aspect of stiffening shows the Motion Element&#39;s<I> 
      characteristic nature </I>of supporting; the aspect of vibrating shows <I>
      its essential function </I>of movement; and the aspect of pushing and 
      pulling shows its <I>manifestation </I>of impelling [17].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Hence, the meditator, noticing the tactile 
      bodily process of rise and fall of the abdomen, accomplishes the 
      observation of <I>the bodily process (rùpa), </I>by getting to know the 
      characteristic nature, etc., of the Element of Motion. Later when he has 
      accomplished the observation of Mind <I>(nàma)</I>, and the observation of 
      both <I>Body and Mind (nàma-rùpa), </I>he will also come to know <I>the 
      general </I>characteristics of the processes concerned, i.e. their 
      impermanence, liability to suffering, and their being void of a self.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But while he is engaged in just noticing 
      the rising and falling of the abdomen and other tactile processes, there 
      will appear thoughts of desire, etc., feelings of pleasure, etc., or acts 
      such as adjusting various parts of the body. At that time, these 
      activities (of mind and body) must be noticed, too. But after noticing 
      them, he should turn again to the continuous noticing of the tactile 
      process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, which is the basic 
      object of mindfulness in this practice.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is a brief sketch of the methodical 
      practice of Insight. It is not the place here to treat it in detail, 
      because this is a brief essay on the Progress of Insight through the 
      Stages of Purification; it is not a treatise explaining in detail the 
      methodical practice of Insight.</FONT></P>
      <FONT COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>II. THE PURIFICATION OF MIND</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">During the early part of the methodical 
      practice, as long as the meditator&#39;s mind is not yet fully purified, 
      wandering thoughts arising by his thinking of objects of sense desire, 
      etc., will also appear intermittently between thoughts of noticing (the 
      objects of meditation). Sometimes the meditator (the beginner) will 
      perceive the occurrence (of these interruptions) and sometimes he will 
      not. But even if he perceives them, it will be only after a short time has 
      lapsed after their appearance. For, then, the momentary concentration of 
      his mind is still very tender and weak. So these wandering thoughts 
      continue to hinder his mind while it is occupied in developing the 
      practice of noticing. Hence, these wandering thoughts are called 
      &#39;hindering thoughts&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When, however, the momentary concentration 
      of his mind has become strong, the thought process of noticing becomes 
      well concentrated. Hence, when attending to the objects to be noticed -- 
      the abdominal movement, sitting, touching, bending, stretching, seeing, 
      hearing, etc., -- his noticing thoughts now appear as if falling upon 
      these objects, as if striking at them, as if confronting them again and 
      again. Then, as a rule, his mind will no longer go elsewhere. Only 
      occasionally, and in a slight degree, will this happen, and even in those 
      cases he will be able to notice any such stray thought at its very 
      arising, as expressed in common speech; or, to be exact, he will notice 
      the stray thought immediately after its actual arising. Then that stray 
      thought will subside as soon as it is noticed, and will not arise again. 
      Immediately afterwards he will also be able to resume continuous noticing 
      of any object as it becomes evident to him. That is why his mind at that 
      time is called &#39;unhindered&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While thus practising the exercise of 
      noticing with &#39;unhindered mind&#39;, the noticing mind will get more close to 
      and fixed at whichever object is noticed, and the act of noticing will 
      proceed without break. At that time there arises in him, in uninterrupted 
      succession, &#39;the concentration of mind lasting for a moment&#39;, directed to 
      each object noticed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is called <I>&#39;Purification of Mind&#39;</I> 
      [18].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Though that concentration has only 
      momentary duration, its power of resistance to being overwhelmed by 
      opposition corresponds to that of Access Concentration.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the Commentary to the <I>Visuddhi 
      Magga, </I>in the explanation of the Chapter relating to Respiration 
      Mindfulness, it is said thus: &quot; &#39;Momentary unification of mind&#39; means the 
      concentration of mind lasting only for a moment. For that (type of 
      concentration), too, when it occurs uninterruptedly with its respective 
      object in a single mode and is not overcome by opposition, fixes the mind 
      immovably, as if in absorption.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;It occurs uninterruptedly with its 
      respective object&quot; refers to the uninterrupted continuity of the thoughts 
      engaged in noticing; after noticing one subject, one attends, in the same 
      manner, to another that follows immediately [19]; again, having noticed 
      that object, one turns to the one following next, and so on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;In a single mode&quot; means: though the 
      objects to be noticed as they present themselves, are numerous and varied, 
      yet the force of concentration of the mind uninterruptedly engaged in 
      noticing remains virtually on the same level. For, what is meant here is: 
      just as the first object was noticed with a certain degree of 
      concentration, so the second, third and other subsequent objects are 
      noticed in each case with the same degree of concentration.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Is not overcome by opposition&quot;: this 
      means that the Momentary Concentration in its uninterrupted flow, is not 
      overwhelmed by the Mental Hindrances [20].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;As if in absorption&quot;: this means that the 
      strength of the Momentary Concentration is similar to that of 
      concentration which has reached full mental absorption. However, such 
      similarity of momentary concentration with fully absorbed concentration 
      will become evident (only) when the methodical practice of Insight reaches 
      its culmination [21] .</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But is it not said in the Commentaries 
      that the term &#39;Purification of Mind&#39; applies only to Access Concentration 
      and Fully Absorbed Concentration? That is true; but one has to take this 
      statement in the sense that Momentary Concentration is included in Access 
      Concentration. For in the Commentary to the Satipatthàna Sutta it is said: 
      &quot;The remaining twelve exercises are subjects of meditation leading only to 
      Access Concentration&quot; [22] Now, in the case of the subjects dealt with in 
      the sections of the Satipatthàna Sutta on Postures, Clear Comprehension 
      and Elements, the concentration of one who devotes himself to these 
      exercises will be definitely only Momentary Concentration. But as the 
      latter is able to suppress the Hindrances just as Access Concentration 
      does [23], and since it is the neighbourhood of the 
      Noble-path-attainment-concentration [24], therefore that same Momentary 
      Concentration is spoken of by the name of &#39;Access&#39; (or Neighbourhood), and 
      also the meditation subjects that produce that Momentary Concentration are 
      called &#39;meditation subjects leading to Access Concentra-tion&#39;. Hence, it 
      should be taken that Momentary Concentration, having the capacity to 
      suppress the Hindrances, has also the right to the name &#39;Access&#39; and 
      &#39;Purification of Mind.&#39; Otherwise &#39;Purification of Mind&#39; could not come 
      about in one who has made Bare Insight his vehicle, by employing only 
      Insight, without having produced either Access Concentration or Fully 
      Absorbed Concentration.</FONT></P>
      <B><FONT COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman">
      <P>III. PURIFICATION OF VIEW</P>
      </FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. Analytical Knowledge of Body and Mind</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Endowed with the &#39;Purification of Mind&#39; 
      and continuing the practice of noticing, the meditator now gets to know 
      body-and-mind analytically as follows: &#39;The rising (i.e. upward movement 
      of the abdomen) is one process; the falling (i.e. downward movement) is 
      another; sitting is another; touching is another, etc.&#39; In that way he 
      gets to know how to distinguish each bodily process that he notices. 
      Further: &#39;The knowing of the rising movement is one process; the knowing 
      of the falling movement is another.&#39; In that way he gets to know each 
      mental act of noticing. Furthermore: &#39;The rising movement is one process; 
      the knowing of it is another. The falling movement is one process; the 
      knowing of it is another,&#39; and so on. In that way he gets to know how to 
      distinguish each bodily and mental process. All that knowledge, indeed, 
      comes from simple noticing, not from reasoning; that is to say: it is 
      knowledge by direct experience arrived at by the mere act of noticing, and 
      not knowledge derived from ratiocination.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus, when seeing a visual object with the 
      eye, the meditator knows how to distinguish each single factor involved: 
      &#39;The eye is one; the visual object is another; seeing is another, and 
      knowing it is another.&#39; The same manner applies in the case of the other 
      sense functions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For, at that time, in each act of 
      noticing, the meditator comes to know analytically the mental processes of 
      noticing, and those of thinking and reflecting, knowing them for himself 
      through direct knowledge, by his experience; thus: &#39;They have the nature 
      of going towards an object, inclining towards an object, cognizing an 
      object.&#39; On the other hand, he knows analytically the material processes 
      going on in the whole body, which are here called by the names of the 
      &#39;rising and falling movements of the abdomen&#39;, &#39;sitting&#39;, etc., knowing 
      them thus: &#39;These have <I>not </I>the nature of going or inclining towards 
      an object, or of cognizing an object.&#39; Such knowing is called &#39;knowing 
      matter (or the body) by its manifestation of non determining&#39;. For it is 
      said in the <I>Mùla-Tikà, </I>the &#39;Principal Sub-commentary&#39; to the 
      Abhidhamma Vibhanga: &quot;In other words, &#39;non-determining&#39; (as in the passage 
      quoted) should be understood as having no faculty of cognizing an object.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Such knowledge as this, which analyses in 
      each act of noticing both the bodily process noticed and the mental 
      process engaged in noticing, according to their true essential nature, is 
      called &quot;Analytical Knowledge of Body and Mind&quot;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When that knowledge has come to maturity, 
      the meditator understands thus: &#39;At the moment of breathing-in, there is 
      just the rising movement of the abdomen and the knowing of the movement, 
      but there is no self besides; at the moment of breathing-out, there is 
      just the falling movement of the abdomen and the knowing of the movement, 
      but there is no self besides.&#39; Understanding it thus in these and other 
      instances, he knows and sees for himself by noticing thus: &quot;There is here 
      only that pair: a material process as object, and a mental process of 
      knowing it; and it is to that pair alone that the terms of conventional 
      usage &#39;being&#39;, &#39;person&#39; or &#39;soul&#39;, &#39;I&#39; or &#39;another&#39;, &#39;man&#39; or &#39;woman&#39; 
      refer. But apart from that dual process there is no separate person or 
      being, I or another, man or woman.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is called </FONT><I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Purification of View&quot;.</FONT></P>

      </FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. Knowledge by discerning Conditionality</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When Purification of View has come to 
      maturity, the condition necessary for the bodily and mental processes 
      observed, will also become evident. Firstly, the conscious-ness that is 
      the condition of the (respective) bodily process will be evident. How? For 
      instance, when bending arms or legs, the consciousness intending to bend 
      these limbs is evident. So the meditator first notices that consciousness, 
      and next he notices the act of bending, and so on. Then he understands by 
      direct experience: &#39;When there is conscious-ness, intending to bend a 
      limb, the bodily process of bending arises; when there is consciousness 
      intending to stretch a limb, the bodily process of stretching arises.&#39; And 
      in the same way he understands other instances also, by direct experience.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Again he also understands by direct 
      experience the condition for the mental process, in the following manner: 
      In the case of consciousness desirous of running off the track, there 
      arises first a corresponding consciousness giving initial attention (to 
      the distracting object). If that consciousness is not noticed (with 
      mindfulness), then there arises a consciousness that runs off the track. 
      But if the consciousness of initial attention to the distracting object is 
      noticed and known, no stray thought will arise. It is similar in the case 
      of other (types of consciousness, for instance when taking delight or 
      being angry, greedy, etc.). When both the sense-door of the eye and a 
      visual object are present, there arises visual consciousness; otherwise 
      visual consciousness will not arise; and so it is in the case of the other 
      sense-doors. If there is a noticeable or recognizable object, then there 
      arises consciousness engaged in noticing or thinking or reasoning or 
      understanding, as the case may be; otherwise no such consciousness arises. 
      Similarly he understands in the case of every other instance (of mind-door 
      cognition).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At that time, the meditator will generally 
      experience many and various painful feelings arising in his body. Now, 
      while one of these feelings is being noticed (but without concern), 
      another feeling will arise elsewhere; and while that is being noticed, 
      again another will appear elsewhere. Thus the meditator follows each 
      feeling as it arises and notices it. But though he is engaged in noticing 
      these feelings as they arise, he will only perceive their initial phase of 
      &quot;arising&quot; and not their final phase of &quot;dissolution&quot;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Also many mental images of various shapes 
      will then appear. The shape of a Dagoba, monk, man, house, tree, park, 
      heavenly mansion, cloud, and many other such images of various kind will 
      appear. Here too, while the meditator is still engaged in noticing one of 
      these mental images, another will show itself; while still noticing that, 
      yet another will appear.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Following thus the mental images as they 
      arise, he goes on noticing them. But though he is engaged in noticing 
      them, he will perceive only their initial phase, not the final phase.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He now understands: Consciousness arises 
      in accordance with each object that becomes evident. If there is an 
      object, there arises consciousness; if there is no object, no 
      consciousness arises.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Between sequences of noticing he also, by 
      considering inferentially, comes to know thus: &#39;It is due to the presence 
      of such causes and conditions as Ignorance, Craving, Kamma, etc., that 
      Body-and-Mind continue.&#39; Such discernment through direct experience and 
      through inference as described, when noticing Body-and-Mind with their 
      conditions, is called &#39;Knowledge of discerning Conditionality&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When that knowledge has come to maturity, 
      the meditator will perceive only body-and-mind processes occurring in 
      strict accordance with their particular and appropriate conditions and he 
      comes to the conclusion: Here is only a <I>conditioning</I> body-and-mind 
      process and a <I>conditioned </I>body-and-mind process. Apart from these, 
      there is no person who performs the bending of the limbs, etc., or who 
      experiences feelings of pain, etc...</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is called </FONT><I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#39;Purification (of insight) by Overcoming 
      Doubt&#39;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. Knowledge of Comprehension</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When this &#39;Purification (of Insight) by 
      Overcoming Doubt&#39; has reached maturity, the meditator will discern 
      distinctly the initial, middle and final phases of any object noticed by 
      him. Then, in the case of various objects noticed, he will discern 
      distinctly that, only after each earlier process has ceased, there arises 
      a subsequent process. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For instance, only when the rising 
      movement of the abdomen has come to an end, there arises the falling 
      movement; only when that has ended, there is again a rising movement. So 
      also in the case of walking: only when the lifting of the foot has come to 
      end, there arises the carrying forward of <B>the </B>foot; only when that 
      has been completed, there follows the placing of the foot on the ground.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the case of painful feelings, only 
      after each single feeling occurring at its particular place has ceased, 
      will another new feeling arise at another place. On noticing the 
      respective painful feeling repeatedly, twice, thrice or more, the 
      meditator will see that it gradually grows less, and at last ceases 
      entirely.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the case of the variously shaped images 
      that enter the mind&#39;s field, it is only after each single image noticed 
      has vanished, that another new object will come into the mind&#39;s focus. On 
      noticing them attentively twice, thrice or more, he will see well that 
      these mental objects which are being noticed, move from one place to 
      another, or they become gradually smaller and less distinct, until at last 
      they disappear entirely. The meditator, however, does not perceive 
      anything that is permanent and lasting, or free from destruction and 
      disappearance.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Seeing how each object, even while being 
      noticed, comes to destruction and disappearance, the meditator comprehends 
      it as <I>impermanent </I>in the sense of undergoing destruction. He 
      further comprehends it as <I>suffering </I>(painful) in the sense of 
      breaking up after each arising. Having seen how various painful feelings 
      arise in continuous succession; that, if one painful feeling ceases, 
      another arises, and when that has ceased, again another arises, -- having 
      seen that, he comprehends the respective objects just as a conglomeration 
      of suffering. Further he comprehends the object as consisting of mere <I>
      impersonal</I> phenomena without a master, in the sense of not arising of 
      (or by) themselves, but arising subject to conditions and then breaking 
      up.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This comprehension of an object noticed, 
      as being impermanent, painful and without a self (impersonal), through 
      knowing its nature of impermanency, etc., by means of simply noticing, 
      without reflecting and reasoning, is called &#39;Knowledge by Comprehension 
      through Direct Experience&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Having thus seen the three characteristics 
      once or several times, by direct experience, the meditator, by inference 
      from the direct experience of those objects noticed, comprehends all 
      bodily and mental processes of past, present and future and the whole 
      world, by coming to the conclusion: &quot;They too, are in the same way, 
      impermanent, painful and without a self.&quot; This is called &#39;Knowledge of 
      Comprehension by Inference&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Alluding to this very knowledge it is said 
      in the Patisambhidà Magga, &quot;Whatever there is of materiality, past, 
      present or future, internal or external, coarse or fine, inferior or 
      superior, far or near, -- all materiality he defines as impermanent. That 
      is one kind of comprehension,&quot; and so on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Also in the Commentary to the Kathàvatthu 
      it is said: &quot;Even if the impermanence of only a single formation 
      (conditioned phenomenon) is known, there may be consideration of the rest 
      by induction thus: &#39;All formations are impermanent&#39;.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The words &quot;All formations are impermanent&quot;

      mental factors belongs to the Buddhas alone and not to the disciples, 
      therefore He (the Buddha) said thus thereby indicating the Insight by

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Ten Corruptions of Insight </FONT></I>
      </B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[27]</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the meditator, in the exercise of 
      noticing, is able to keep exclusively to the present body-and-mind 
      process, without looking back to past processes or ahead to future ones, 
      then, as a result of Insight, (the mental vision of) a <I>brilliant light
      </I>will appear to him. To one it will appear like the light of a lamp, to 
      others like a flash of lightening, or like the radiance of the moon or the 
      sun, and so on. With one it may last for just one moment, with others it 
      may last longer.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There will also arise in him strong <I>
      mindfulness </I>pertaining to Insight. As a result, all the successive 
      arisings of bodily and mental processes will present themselves to the 
      consciousness engaged in noticing, as if coming to it of themselves; and 
      mindfulness too, seems as if alighting on the processes of itself. 
      Therefore the meditator then believes: &#39;There is no body-and-mind process 
      in which mindfulness fails to engage.&#39;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">His<I> knowledge </I>consisting in 
      Insight, here called &#39;noticing&#39;, will be likewise keen, strong and lucid. 
      Consequently he will discern clearly and in separate forms all the bodily 
      and mental processes noticed, as if cutting to pieces a bamboo sprout with 
      a well-sharpened knife. Therefore the meditator then believes: &#39;There is 
      no body-and-mind process that cannot be noticed.&#39; When examining the 
      characteristics of Impermanence, etc., or other aspects of reality, he 
      understands everything quite clearly and at once, and he believes it to be 
      the knowledge derived from direct experience.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Further, strong <I>faith </I>pertaining to 
      Insight, arises in him. Under its influence, the meditator&#39;s mind, when 
      engaged in noticing or thinking, is serene and without any disturbance; 
      and when he is engaged in recollecting the virtues of the Buddha, the 
      Dhamma and the Sangha, his mind quite easily gives itself over to them. 
      There arise in him: the wish to proclaim the Buddha&#39;s Teaching, joyous 
      confidence in the virtues of those engaged in meditation, the desire to 
      advise dear friends and relatives to practise meditation, grateful 
      remembrance of the help received from his meditation master, his spiritual 
      mentor, etc., -- these and many other similar mental processes will occur.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There arises also <I>rapture </I>in its 
      five grades, beginning with minor rapture [28]. When Purification of Mind 
      is gained, that rapture begins to appear by causing &#39;goose-flesh&#39;, tremor 
      in the limbs, etc.; and now it produces a sublime feeling of happiness and 
      exhilaration, filling the whole body with an exceedingly sweet and subtle 
      thrill. Under its influence, he feels as if the whole body had risen up 
      and remained in the air without touching the ground or as if it were 
      seated on an air cushion, or as if it were floating up and down.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There arises <I>tranquillity </I>of mind 
      with the characteristic of quietening the disturbances of conscious-ness 
      and its mental concomitants; and along with it appear mental agility, etc 
      [29]. When walking, standing, sitting or reclining there is, under the 
      influence of these mental qualities, no disturbance of consciousness and 
      its mental concomitants, nor heaviness, rigidity, unwieldiness, sickness 
      or crookedness [30]. Rather his consciousness and its mental concomitants 
      are tranquil through having reached the supreme relief in non-action [31]. 
      They are agile in always functioning swiftly; they are pliant in being 
      able to attend to any object desired; they are wieldy in being able to 
      attend to an object for any length of time desired; they are quite lucid 
      through their proficiency, that is, through the ease with which Insight 
      penetrates the object; they are also straight through being directed, 
      inclined and turned only towards wholesome activities.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There also arises a very sublime feeling 
      of <I>happiness</I> suffusing all his body. Under its influence he, then, 
      becomes exceedingly joyous and he believes: &#39;Now I am happy all the time&#39; 
      or &#39;Now, indeed, I have found happiness never felt before,&#39; and he wants 
      to tell others of his extraordinary experience. With reference to that 
      rapture and happiness, which are aided by the factors of tranquillity, 
      etc., it was said:</FONT></P>

      </DIR>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There arises in him <I>energy </I>that is 
      neither too lax nor too tense, but is vigorous and acts evenly. For 
      formerly his energy was sometimes lax, and so he was overpowered by sloth 
      and torpor; hence, he could not notice keenly and continuously the objects 
      as they became evident, and his understanding, too, was not clear. And at 
      other times his energy was too tense, and so he was overpowered by 
      agitation, with the same result of being unable to notice keenly, etc. But 
      now his energy is neither too lax nor too tense, but is vigorous and acts 
      evenly: and so getting over these shortcomings of sloth, torpor and 
      agitation, he is able to notice the objects present keenly and 
      continuously, and his understanding is quite clear, too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There also arises in him strong <I>
      equanimity </I>associated with Insight, which is neutral towards all 
      formations. Under its influence he regards with neutrality even his 
      examination of the nature of these formations with respect to their being 
      impermanent, etc.; and he is able to notice keenly and continuously the 
      bodily and mental processes arising at the time. Then his activity of 
      noticing is carried on without effort, and proceeds, as it were, of 
      itself. Also in adverting to the objects, there arises in him strong 
      equanimity, by virtue of which his mind enters, as it were, quickly into 
      the objects of advertence [32].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There arises further a subtle <I>
      attachment </I>of a calm nature that enjoys the Insight graced with the 
      &#39;brilliant light&#39; and the other qualities here described. The meditator, 
      however, is not able to discern it as a corruption but believes it to be 
      just the very bliss of meditation. So meditators speak in praise of it 
      thus: &#39;Only now do I find full delight in meditation!&#39;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Having felt such rapture and happiness 
      accompanied by the &#39;brilliant light&#39; and enjoying the very act of perfect 
      noticing which is ably functioning with ease and rapidity, the meditator 
      now believes: &#39;Surely I must have attained to the Supramundane Path and 
      Fruition! [33] Now I have finished the task of meditation.&#39; This is 
      mistaking what is not the Path for the Path, and it is a corruption of 
      Insight which usually takes place in the manner just described. But even 
      if the meditator does not take the &#39;brilliant light&#39; and the other 
      corruptions, as an indication of the Path and Fruition, still he feels 
      delight in them. This is, likewise a corruption of Insight. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Therefore, the knowledge consisting in 
      noticing, even if quick in its functioning, is called, &#39;the early stage of 
      (or &#39;weak&#39;) Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away,&#39; if it is beset and 
      corrupted by those corruptions. For the same reason the meditator is at 
      that time not in a position to discern quite distinctly the arising and 
      passing away of bodily and mental processes.</FONT></P>

      <P>V. PURIFICATION BY KNOWLEDGE AND VISION OF WHAT IS PATH AND NOT-PATH</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While engaged in noticing, the meditator, 
      either by himself or through instructions from someone else, comes to this 
      decision: &#39;The Brilliant Light and the other things experienced by me, are 
      not the Path. Delight in them is merely a corruption of Insight. The 
      practice of conti-nuously noticing the object as it becomes evident -- 
      that alone is the way of Insight. I must go on with just the work of 
      noticing.&#39; This decision is called <I>&#39;Purification by Knowledge and 
      Vision of what is Path and</I> </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">

      <P>VI. PURIFICATION BY KNOWLEDGE AND VISION OF THE COURSE OF PRACTICE</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After noticing these manifestations of 
      Brilliant Light and the others, or after leaving them unheeded, he goes on 
      continuously as before with the act of noticing the bodily and mental 
      processes as they become evident at the six sense-doors. While thus 
      engaged in noticing, he gets over the corruptions relating to brilliant 
      light, rapture, tranquil-lity, happiness, attachment, etc., and his 
      knowledge remains concerned exclusively with the arising and passing away 
      of the processes noticed. For then, at each act of noticing, he sees: &#39;The 
      noticed object having arisen, disappears instantly&#39;; and it also becomes 
      clear to him that each object disappears just where it arises; it does not 
      move on to another place. In that way he understands by direct experience 
      how bodily and mental processes arise and break up from moment to moment. 
      It is such knowledge and understanding resulting from the continuous 
      noticing of bodily and mental processes as they arise and dissolve moment 
      after moment, and the discernment, in separate sections, of the arising 
      and passing away of each of them, while being free from the corruptions, 
      that is called &#39;final Knowledge of Contemplation of Arising and Passing 
      Away&#39;. This is the beginning of &#39;Purification by Knowledge and Vision of 
      the Course of Practice&#39; which starts from this insight and extends to 
      Adaptation Knowledge (No.13).</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">5. Knowledge of Dissolution</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Noticing the bodily and mental processes 
      as they arise, he sees them part by part, link by link, piece by piece, 
      fraction by fraction: &#39;Just now it arises, just now it dissolves.&#39; When 
      that Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away becomes mature, keen and 
      strong, it will arise easily and proceed uninterruptedly as if borne 
      onward of itself; also the bodily and mental processes will be easily 
      discernible. When keen knowledge thus carries on and formations are easily 
      discernible, then neither the arising of each bodily and mental process, 
      nor its middle phase called &#39;presence&#39;, nor the continuity of bodily and 
      mental processes called &#39;occurrence as unbroken flux&#39; is apparent to him; 
      nor are apparent to him the shape of hand, foot, face, body, and so on. 
      But what is apparent to him is only the <I>ceasing </I>of bodily and 
      mental processes, called vanishing, or passing away, or dissolution.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For instance, while noticing the rising 
      movement of the abdomen, neither its initial nor middle phase is apparent, 
      but only the ceasing or vanishing which is called the final phase, is 
      apparent; and so it is also with the falling movement of the abdomen. 
      Again, in the case of bending an arm or leg, while noticing the act of 
      bending, neither the initial nor the middle phase of bending is apparent, 
      nor is the form of the limb apparent, but only, the final phase of ceasing 
      and vanishing is apparent. It is similar in the other cases of stretching 
      a limb, and so on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For at that time each object that is being 
      noticed, seems to him to be entirely absent or to have become 
      non-existent. Consequently, at this stage of knowledge, it seems to him as 
      if he were engaged in noticing something which has already become absent 
      or non-existent by having vanished; and the consciousness engaged in 
      noticing appears to have lost contact with the object that is being 
      noticed. It is for that reason that a meditator may here think: &#39;I have 
      lost the Insight&#39;; but he should not think so.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For formerly his consciousness normally 
      took delight in conceptual objects of shapes, etc. [34], and even as far 
      as up to the Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away, the idea of formations 
      with their specific features [35] was always apparent to him. Hence, his 
      mind took delight in a plainly distinguishable object consisting of 
      formations, with its particular structure [36] and its particular 
      feature-idea. But now that his knowledge has developed in the way 
      described, no such idea of the formations&#39; features or structure, appears 
      to him, still less any other, cruder, concept. At such a stage, the <I>
      arising </I>of formations, that is, the first phase of the process, is not 
      apparent (as it is in the case of &#39;Knowledge of Arising and Passing 
      Away&#39;), but there is apparent only the dissolution, that is, the final 
      phase, having the nature of vanishing. Therefore, the meditator&#39;s mind 
      does not take delight in it at first, but he may be sure that soon, after 
      becoming familiar (with that stage of the practice), his mind will delight 
      in the cessation (of the phenomena), too, which is called their 
      dissolution. With this assurance he should again turn to the practice of 
      continuous noticing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When thus engaged, he perceives that in 
      each act of noticing there are always present two factors, that is, an 
      objective and subjective one -- the object noticed and the mental state of 
      knowing it -- which dissolve and vanish by pairs, one pair after the 
      other. For in each single instance of a rising movement of the abdomen, 
      there are, in fact, numerous physical processes constituting the rising 
      movement, which are seen to dissolve serially. It is like seeing the 
      continuous successive vanishing of a summer mirage moment by moment; or it 
      is like the quick and continuous bursting of bubbles produced in a heavy 
      shower by thick rain drops falling on a water surface; or it is like the 
      quick, successive extinction of oil-lamps or candles, blown out by the 
      wind, as these lights are being offered at a shrine by devotees. Similar 
      to that appears the dissolving and vanishing, moment by moment, of the 
      bodily processes noticed. And the dissolution of consciousness noticing 
      those bodily processes is apparent to him along with the dissolution of 
      the bodily processes. Also while he is noticing other bodily and mental 
      processes, their dissolution, too, will be apparent to him in the same 
      manner. Consequently, the knowledge will come to him that whatever part of 
      the whole body is noticed, that object ceases first, and after it the 
      consciousness engaged in noticing that object follows in its wake. From 
      that the meditator will understand very clearly in the case of each 
      successive pair the dissolution of any object whatsoever and the 
      dissolution of the consciousness noticing that very object. (It should be 
      borne in mind that this refers only to understanding arrived at through 
      direct experience by one engaged in noticing only; it is not an opinion 
      derived from mere reasoning.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is the perfectly clear understanding of 
      the dissolution of the two things, pair by pair, -- that is, (1) of the 
      visual or other object appearing at any of the six sense - doors, and (2) 
      of the consciousness noticing that very object -- that is called 
      &#39;Knowledge of Dissolution&#39;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">6. Awareness of Fearfulness</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When that &#39;Knowledge of Dissolution&#39; is 
      mature, there will, just by seeing the dissolution of all 
      object-and-subject formations, gradually arise &#39;Awareness of Fearfulness&#39; 
      [37] and other (higher) knowledges, together with their respective aspects 
      of fear, and so on [38].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Having seen how the dissolution of two 
      things -- that is any object noticed and the Insight-thought engaged in 
      noticing it -- takes place moment by moment, the meditator also 
      understands by inference that in the past, too, every conditioned thing 
      (formation) has broken up in the same way, that so it will break up also 
      in future and that at present it breaks up, too. And just at the time of 
      noticing any formations that are evident, these formations will appear to 
      him in their aspect of fearfulness. Therefore, during the very act of 
      noticing, the meditator will also come to understand: &#39;These formations 
      are indeed fearful.&#39;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Such understanding of their fearfulness is 
      called &#39;Knowledge of the Awareness of Fearfulness&#39;; it has also the name 
      &#39;Knowledge of Fear&#39;. At that time, his mind itself is gripped by fear and 
      seems helpless.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">7. Knowledge of Misery</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When he has realised the fearfulness (of 
      the formations) through the &#39;Knowledge of Fear&#39;, and keeps on noticing 
      continuously, then the &#39;Knowledge of Misery&#39; will arise in him before 
      long. When it has arisen, all formations everywhere whether amongst the 
      objects noticed, or among the states of consciousness engaged in noticing, 
      or in any kind of life or existence that is brought to mind -- will appear 
      insipid, without a vitalizing factor [39], and unsatisfying. So he sees, 
      at that time, only suffering, only unsatisfactoriness, only misery. 
      Therefore this stage is called &#39;Knowledge of Misery&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">8. Knowledge of Disgust</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Seeing thus the misery in conditioned 
      things (formations), his mind finds no delight in those miserable things, 
      but is entirely disgusted with them. At time, his mind becomes, as it 
      were, discontented and listless. Even so he does not give up the practice 
      of Insight, but spends his time continuously engaging in it. He therefore 
      should know that this state of mind is not dissatisfaction with 
      meditation, but is precisely the &#39;Knowledge of Disgust&#39; that has the 
      aspect of being disgusted with the formations. Even if he directs his 
      thought to the happiest sort of life and existence, or to the most 
      pleasant and desirable objects, his mind will not take delight in them, 
      will find no satisfaction in them. On the contrary, his mind will incline 
      and lean and tend only towards Nibbàna. Therefore the following thought 
      will arise in him between moments of noticing: &#39;The ceasing of all 
      formations that are dissolving from moment to moment -- that alone is 
      happiness.&#39;</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">9. Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When through this knowledge (now acquired) 
      he feels disgust with regard to every formation noticed, there will arise 
      in him a desire to forsake these formations or to become delivered from 
      them. The knowledge relating to that desire is called &#39;Knowledge of Desire 
      for Deliverance&#39;. At that time, usually various painful feelings arise in 
      his body, and also an unwillingness to remain long in one particular 
      bodily posture. Even if these states do not arise, the comfortless nature 
      of the formations will become more evident than ever. And due to that, 
      between moments of noticing, he feels a longing thus: &#39;Oh, may I soon get 
      free from that! Oh, may I reach the state where these formations cease! 
      Oh, may I be able to give up these formations completely!&#39; At this 
      juncture, his consciousness engaged in noticing, seems to shrink from the 
      object noticed at each moment of noticing, and wish to escape from it.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">10. Knowledge of Re-observation</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Being thus desirous of escaping from the 
      formations, the meditator makes stronger effort and continues the practice 
      of noticing these very formations with the single purpose of forsaking 
      them and escaping from them. For that reason, the knowledge arising at 
      that time, is called &#39;Knowledge of Re-observation&#39;. The term 
      &#39;re-observation&#39; has the same meaning as &#39;re-noticing&#39; or 
      &#39;re-contemplation&#39;. Then the nature (or characteristics) of the formations 
      -- being impermanent, suffering and without a self -- will be clearly 
      evident to him; and among these three, the aspect of suffering will be 
      particularly distinct.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At this stage too, there will usually 
      arise in his body various kinds of pains which are severe, sharp and of 
      growing intensity. Hence, his whole bodily and mental system will seem to 
      him like an unbearable mass of sickness or a conglomeration of suffering. 
      And a state of restlessness will usually manifest itself, making him 
      incapable of keeping to one particular posture for any length of time. For 
      then he will not be able to hold any one position long, but will soon want 
      to change it. This state, however, simply manifests the unbearable nature 
      of the formations. Though he wants to change his bodily posture, still he 
      should not give in easily to that wish, but should endeavour to remain 
      motionless for a longer period in the same posture and continue to carry 
      on the practice of noticing. By doing so he will be able to overcome his 
      restlessness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now his Insight Knowledge is quite strong 
      and lucid, and by virtue of it even his painful feelings will at once 
      cease as soon as they are firmly noticed. Even if a painful feeling does 
      not cease completely, he will perceive that it is dissolving, part by 
      part, from moment to moment. That is to say, the ceasing, vanishing and 
      disappearing of each single moment of feeling will become apparent 
      separately in each corresponding act of noticing. In other words, now it 
      will not be as it was at the time of the &#39;Knowledge of Comprehension&#39;, 
      when the constant flow or continuity of feelings of the same kind was 
      apparent, as a single unit. But if, without abandoning the practice, that 
      feeling of pain is firmly and continuously noticed, it will entirely cease 
      before long. When it ceases in that way, it does so for good and will not 
      arise again. Though in that way the Insight Knowledge may have become 
      strong and perfectly lucid, still he is not satisfied with that much. He 
      will even think: &#39;My Insight Knowledge is not clear.&#39; He should, however, 
      dismiss such thought by applying the act of noticing to it, and he should 
      go on with his task of continuously noticing the bodily and mental 
      formations as they occur.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If he perseveres thus, his noticing will 
      become more and more clear as the time passes in minutes, hours and days. 
      Then he will overcome the painful feelings and the restlessness in being 
      unable to remain long in one particular posture, and also the idea that 
      his Insight Knowledge is not yet clear enough. His noticing will, then, 
      function rapidly, and at every moment of noticing he will understand quite 
      clearly any of the three characteristics of impermanence, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This understanding of any of the three 
      character-ristics of impermanence, etc., through the act of noticing which 
      functions with promptness in quick succession, is called &#39;Strong Knowledge 
      of Re-observation&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">11. Knowledge of Equanimity about 
      Formations</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When this &#39;Knowledge of Re-observation&#39; is 
      mature, there will arise knowledge perceiving evident bodily and mental 
      processes in continuous succession quite naturally, as if borne onward of 
      itself. This is called &#39;Knowledge of Equanimity about Formations&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now, in the act of noticing, effort is no 
      longer required for keeping formations before the mind or for 
      understanding them. After completion of each single act of noticing, the 
      object to be noticed will then appear of itself, and Insight Knowledge, 
      too, will of itself notice and understand it. It is as if no further 
      effort need be made by the meditator. Formerly, owing to seeing the 
      dissolution of formations, there arose, in successive order, the aspect of 
      fearfulness, the perception of misery, the aspect of disgust, the desire 
      for deliverance, and dissatisfaction with the knowledge so far acquired. 
      But now these mental states no longer arise, although also in the present 
      state, the breaking up of formations which are dissolving more rapidly, is 
      perceived closely. Even if a painful feeling arises in the body, no mental 
      disturbance (grief) arises, and there is no lack of fortitude in bearing 
      it. Generally, however, at this stage, pains will be absent entirely, that 
      is to say they do not arise. Even if the meditator thinks about something 
      fearful or sad, no mental disturbance will arise, be it in the form of 
      fear or of sorrow. This, firstly, is the &#39;abandoning of fear&#39;, at the 
      state of &#39;Equanimity about Formations&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the earlier stage, on attaining 
      &#39;Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away&#39;, great joy had arisen on account 
      of the clarity of Insight. But now this kind of joy does not arise, even 
      though there is present the exceedingly peaceful and sublime clarity of 
      mind belonging to &#39;Equanimity about Formations&#39;. Though he actually sees 
      desirable objects conducive to joy, or though he thinks about various 
      enjoyable things, no strong feeling of joy will arise. This is &#39;abandoning 
      of delight&#39; at the stage of &#39;Equanimity about Formations&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He cherishes no desire nor hate with 
      regard to any object, desirable or undesirable, that comes into the range 
      of his sense doors, but taking them as just the same in his act of 
      noticing, he understands them (that is to say, it is a pure act of 
      understanding). This is &#39;equable vision&#39; at the stage of &#39;Equanimity about 
      Formations&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Of these three qualities just mentioned, 
      it is said in the &#39;Path of Purification&#39; (Visuddhi Magga): &quot;Having 
      discarded fear and delight, he is impartial and neutral towards all 
      formations.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If he resumes the practice of noticing 
      with the thought: &quot;Now I will do it vigorously again!&quot;, then, before long, 
      the noticing will function efficiently as if borne onward of itself. From 
      now onwards there is no need for the meditator to make further 
      (deliberate) effort. Though he does not make a (deliberate) effort, his 
      noticing will proceed in a continuous and steady flow for a long time; it 
      will go on even for two or three hours without interruption. This is the 
      &#39;state of long lasting (practice)&#39; of Equanimity about Formations; 
      referring to which it is said in the &#39;Patisambhidà Magga&#39;: &quot; &#39;The wisdom 
      lasting long&#39; is the knowledge present in the mental states of Equanimity 
      about Formations.&quot; The Great Commentary to the &#39;Path of Purification&#39; 
      (Visuddhi Magga) explains as follows: &quot;This is said with reference to 
      knowledge functioning in a continuous flow.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now when noticing functions spontaneously 
      as if borne onward of itself, the mind, even if sent out towards a variety 
      of objects, generally refuses to go; and even if it does go, it will not 
      stay long but will soon return to the usual object to be noticed, and will 
      resume continuous noticing. In this connection it was said: &#39;He shrinks, 
      recoils, and retreats; he does not go forth to it.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">12. Insight leading to Emergence</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, through &#39;Knowledge of Equanimity about 
      Formations&#39;, which is endowed with many virtues, blessings and powers, he 
      notices the formations as they occur. When this knowledge is mature, on 
      having become keen, strong and lucid, and on having reached its 
      culmination point, it will understand any of the formations as being 
      impermanent or painful or without self, just by seeing their dissolution. 
      Now that act of noticing any one characteristic out of the three, which is 
      still more lucid in its perfect understanding, manifests itself two or 
      three times, or more, in rapid succession. This is called &#39;Insight leading 
      to Emergence&#39; [40].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thereupon, immediately after the last 
      consciousness in the series of acts of noticing, belonging to this Insight 
      leading to Emergence, the meditator&#39;s consciousness leaps forth into 
      (taking as its object) Nibbàna which is the cessation of all formations. 
      Then there appears to him the stilling (subsidence) of all formations 
      called &#39;cessation&#39;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This mode of realisation of Nibbàna has 
      been mentioned in many discourses of the Master, for example: &quot;The vision 
      of truth arose: that whatsoever has the nature of arising is bound to 
      cease.&quot; Herein the words &quot;bound to cease&quot;, indicate the aspect of 
      realising the stilling and ceasing of all formations which have the nature 
      of arising.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Also in the &#39;Questions of Milinda&#39; it is 
      said: &quot;His consciousness while carrying on the practice of bringing to 
      mind (= noticing), passes beyond the continuous occurrence of phenomena 
      and alights upon non-occurrence. One who, having practised in correct 
      manner, has alighted upon non-occurrence, 0 king, is said to have realized 
      Nibbàna.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meaning is this: the meditator who 
      wishes to realise Nibbàna, should repeatedly bring to mind, through the 
      practice of noticing, every bodily and mental process that appears at any 
      of the six sense doors. When he brings it to mind thus, his consciousness 
      engaged in noticing -- here called &quot;bringing to mind&quot; -- will until 
      Adaptation Knowledge is reached, fall at every moment upon the 
      (conditioned) bodily and mental formations called here &#39;continuous 
      occurrence&#39;, because they go on occurring over and over again in an 
      unbroken flow, like a river&#39;s current. But in the last phase, instead of 
      falling upon that &#39;continuous occurrence&#39; consciousness passes beyond it 
      and alights upon &#39;non-occurrence&#39; (which is the very opposite of the 
      bodily and mental formations called here &#39;occurrence&#39;). In other words, it 
      arrives at &#39;non-occurrence&#39;; that is to say, it reaches, as if it &quot;alights 
      upon&quot;, cessation which is the stilling of the formations (or conditioned 
      phenomena). When the meditator, having already before practised correctly 
      and without deviation by way of the &#39;Knowledge of Arising and Passing 
      Away&#39; and the other knowledges (or by way of the Purification of Conduct, 
      of Mind, of View, etc.), has in this manner arrived at &#39;non-occurrence&#39; 
      (by the consciousness alighting upon it), he is said to have &#39;realised 
      Nibbàna&#39;, he is called one who has made Nibbàna a direct experience and 
      has actually seen it.</FONT></P>

      and lasts for just an instant, like the duration of a single thought of 
      noticing. Subsequently there arises &#39;Knowledge of Reviewing&#39;. Through that 
      &#39;Knowledge of Reviewing&#39; the meditator discerns that the &#39;Insight leading 
      to Emergence&#39; came along with the very rapid function of noticing, and 
      that immediately after the last phase of noticing the Path Consciousness 
      entered into the cessation (of the formations). This is the &#39;Knowledge of 
      Reviewing the Path&#39;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He also discerns that the consciousness

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Some meditators, but not all, have 
      &#39;Reviewing of Defilemcnts&#39; [45].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After having reviewed in this way, the 
      meditator still continues the practice of noticing bodily and mental 
      processes as they become evident. While he is thus engaged in noticing, 
      the bodily and mental processes, however, appear to him quite coarse, not 
      subtle as before at the time of the &#39;Knowledge of Equanimity about 
      Formations&#39;. Why is it so? It is so because of the fact that the knowledge 
      present now has the nature of the &#39;Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away&#39;. 
      For when the Noble Disciples (namely, stream-winners, etc.) resume the 
      practice of Insight (by noticing), the &#39;Knowledge of Arising and Passing 
      Away&#39; usually arises at the beginning. This is the usual course of order 
      in this respect.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When some meditators, however, emerge from 
      the attainment of Path and Fruition, great faith, happiness, rapture and 
      tranquillity, produced by virtue of the attainment experience, arise 
      flooding the whole body. Owing to that, they are unable to carry out the 
      practice of noticing anything apparent at that time. Even if they make 
      double effort and attempt to proceed with the practice of Insight, they 
      fail to discern the phenomena clearly and separately, at the moment of 
      their occurrence. They continue to experience only rapture, tranquillity 
      and happiness, which occur with great force. This state of mind, which is 
      extraordinarily serene through the strong faith prevailing, lasts for one 
      hour, two hours, or more, without break. Because of this fact, meditators 
      feel as if they were in some such place as a wide open space suffused with 
      radiance and most delightful. The rapture and happiness, of a serene 
      character, that arise then, are praised by meditators thus: &quot;Surely, I 
      have never before felt and experienced such happiness!&quot; After two or three 
      hours have passed, that faith, happiness, rapture and tranquillity will 
      fade. The meditators can once again proceed with noticing the bodily and 
      mental processes as they &#39;occur, distinguishing them separately, and they 
      will be able to discern them clearly. But at that time too, first the 
      &#39;Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away&#39; will appear.</FONT></P>

      stage of &#39;Equanimity about Formations&#39; again. But if his power of 
      concentration is still short of perfection, only the &#39;Equanimity about 
      Formations&#39; will go on repeating itself. But if his concentration has 
      reached perfection, then, in the case of one who does the Insight practice 
      of noticing with a view of attaining only to the first Path and Fruition, 
      the Fruition consciousness of the First Path alone reaches cessation of 
      formations by way of the <I>Attainment of Fruition </I>[46]. This occurs 
      in precisely the same way as the Path and Fruition consciousness occurred 
      before in the consciousness-sequence belonging to the initial attainment 
      of the First Path. The only difference here is the capacity of the 
      Fruition Attainment to last long.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One should also set one&#39;s mind resolutely 
      upon the further tasks: to be able to repeat the achievement of Fruition 
      Attainment, to achieve it rapidly, and, at the time of achievement, to 
      abide in it a long time, say for 6, 10, 15 or 30 minutes, for an hour or 
      more.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In one who applies himself to achieving 
      the Attainment of Fruition, &#39;Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away&#39;, will 
      arise at the beginning. Advancing from there in the due sequence, soon the 
      &#39;Knowledge of Equanimity about Formations&#39; is reached. But when skill in 
      the practice has <U>been</U> acquired, the &#39;Knowledge of Equanimity about 
      Formations&#39; will arise, soon, even after four or five acts of noticing. If 
      the power of concentration has reached perfection, the Fruition 
      consciousness will, repeatedly, get absorbed in cessation by way of 
      Fruition Attainment. The mind can thus reach absorption even while one is 
      walking up and down, or while taking a meal, and the Fruition Attainment 
      can remain for any length of time as resolved. During the Fruition 
      Attainment, the mind will abide only in the cessation of formations, and 
      will not be aware of anything else.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">19. The Higher Paths and Fruitions</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the meditator has thus become skilled 
      in achieving the Fruition Attainment, he should resolutely set his mind 
      upon the task of attaining to the higher Paths and Fruitions. What should 
      now be done by one who has set himself that task? Just as before, he 
      should carry out the practice of noticing (anything occurring) at the six 
      sense-doors.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Hence, the meditator should notice any 
      bodily and mental process that becomes evident to him at the six 
      sense-doors. While he is thus engaged, he will see, at the stage of 
      &#39;Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away&#39;, that the first objects consisting 
      of formations appear to him rather coarse, and that his mind is not well 
      concentrated. The development of Insight belonging to the higher Paths is, 
      in fact, not as easy as that of Insight belonging to the Fruition 
      Attainment already achieved by the meditator. It is in fact somewhat 
      difficult, due to the fact that Insight has to be developed anew. It is, 
      however, not so very difficult as it was at the first time when beginning 
      the practice. In a single day, or even in a single hour, he can gain the 
      &#39;Knowledge of Equanimity about Formations&#39;. This statement is made here, 
      basing it on the experience usually gained by persons of the present day, 
      who had to be given guidance from the start, and who did not possess 
      particularly strong intelligence. Here it is applied, by inference, to 
      similar types of persons in general.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But although &#39;Equanimity about Formations&#39; 
      has been attained it just goes on by repeating itself, if the Spiritual 
      Faculties [47] have not yet reached full maturity. Though he who has won 
      (one of the lower) Fruitions may be able to enter into it several times 
      within one hour, yet if his spiritual faculties are immature, he cannot 
      attain the next-higher Path within as much as one day, two, three or more 
      days. He abides merely in &#39;Equanimity about Formations&#39;. If, however, he 
      then directs his mind to reach the Fruition already attained, he will 
      reach it perhaps in two or three minutes.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When, however, the spiritual Faculties are 
      mature, one who carries out the practice of Insight for attaining to a 
      higher Path, will find that immediately after &#39;Equanimity about 
      Formations&#39; has reached its culmination, the Higher Path and Fruition 
      arise in the same way as before (i.e., as at the time of the First Path 
      and Fruition), that is to say, it is preceded by the stages of Adaptation 
      and Maturity. After the Fruition, the stages of &#39;Revicwing&#39;, etc., that 
      follow, are also the same as before.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Anything else concerning the method of 
      practice for Insight and the progress of knowledge right up to Arahantship 
      can be understood in precisely the same way as described. Hence, there is 
      no need for elaborating it any further.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">*</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now, the present treatise on the &quot;Progress 
      of Insight through the Stages of Purification&quot; has been written in a 
      concise form, so that meditators can easily comprehend it. Hence, complete 
      details have not been given here. And since it was written with a view to 
      being easily intelligible, in many passages of this treatise relevant 
      canonical references have not been quoted, and there are repetitions in it 
      and other faults of literary composition. But these shortcomings of 
      presentation and the incompleteness of canonical references, may here be 
      overlooked by the reader. Only the meaning and purpose should be heeded 
      well by the wise. It is to this that I would invite the reader&#39;s 
      attention.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Though in the beginning it was mentioned 
      that this treatise has been written for those who have already obtained 
      distinctive results in their practice, others may perhaps read it with 
      advantage, too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now these are my concluding good wishes 
      for the latter type of readers: Just as a very delicious, appetizing, 
      tasty and nutritious meal can be appreciated fully only by him who has 
      himself eaten it, and not without partaking of it -- in the same way, the 
      whole series of developments of knowledge described here can be understood 
      fully only by one who has himself seen it by direct experience, and not 
      otherwise. So may all good people reach the stage of indubitable 
      understanding of this whole series of knowledge-developments! May they 
      also strive to attain it!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[1]. Here, and in the title of this 
      treatise, the Pàli term <I>nàna</I> has been rendered by &quot;Insight&quot;, as, at 
      the outset, the word &quot;knowledge&quot; (being the normal rendering of <I>nàna)</I>, 
      might not be taken by the reader with the full weight and significance 
      which it will receive in the context of the present treatise. In all the 
      following occurrences, however, this Pàli term has been translated by 
      &quot;knowledge&quot;, while the word &quot;insight&quot; has been reserved for the Pàli term
      <I>&quot;vipassanà&quot;</I>. When referring to the several types and stages of 
      Knowledge, the plural &quot;knowledges&quot;, has been used, in conformity with the 
      Pàli (<I>nànàni</I>).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[2]. In the canonical Buddhist scriptures, 
      the seven Stages of Purification <I>(visuddhi) </I>are mentioned in the 
      &quot;Discourse on the Stage Coaches&quot; (Majjhima-Nikàya No. 24). They are the 
      frame work of the Venerable Buddhaghosa&#39;s &quot;Path of Purification&quot;<I> 
      (Visuddhi-magga) </I>where they are explained in full (see the translation 
      by Nyanamoli Thera, publ. by A. Semage, Colombo 11, Ceylon).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[3]. &#39;Motion&#39; (<I>vàyo</I>, lit.: wind, 
      air) refers to the last of the four material elements <I>(dhàtu), </I>or 
      primary qualities of matter. The other three are: Earth (solidity, 
      hardness), Water (adhesion), and Fire (caloricity). These four Elements, 
      in varying proportional strength, are present in all forms of matter. The 
      so-called &#39;inner Wind Element&#39; which applies in this context, is active in 
      the body as motion, vibration and pressure, manifesting itself in the 
      passage of air through the body (e.g. in breathing), in the movement and 
      pressure of limbs and organs, and so on. It becomes perceptible as a 
      tactile process, or object of touch <I>(photthabbàrammana), </I>through 
      the pressure caused by it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[4]. The attention directed to the 
      movement of the abdomen, was introduced into the methodical practice of 
      Insight meditation by the author of this treatise, the Venerable Mahàsì 
      Sàyadaw, and forms here the basic object of meditative practice. For 
      details see <I>The Heart of Buddhist Meditation, </I>by Nyanaponika Thera 
      (Rider &amp; Co., London 1962), p. 94f, 106. If preferred, breath itself, 
      instead, may be taken as the basic object of meditative attention, 
      according to the traditional method of &#39;Mindfulness of Breathing&#39; <I>
      (ànàpànasati): </I>on which see &quot;Heart of Buddhist Meditation&quot;, p. 108ff; 
      &quot;Mindfulness of Breathing&quot;, by Nyanamoli Thera (Buddhist Publication 
      Society, Kandy).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[5]. According to Buddhist teachings 
      (Abhidhamma), only the three Elements of Earth, Fire, and Wind constitute 
      the tactile substance in matter. The Element of water is not held to be an 
      object of touch also not in cases where it predominates, as in liquids. 
      What is tactile in any given liquid is the contribution of the first-named 
      three Elements to its composite nature.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[6]. &#39;Door&#39; is a figurative expression for 
      the sense organs (which, including the mind, are sixfold), because they 
      provide, as it were, the access to the world of objects.</FONT></P>

      frequently used in the Discourses (Sutta) of the Buddha for referring to

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[14]. This method of meditation aims at 
      &#39;knowledge by direct experience&#39; (paccakkhanàna), resulting from 
      mindfulness directed towards <I>one&#39;s own </I>bodily and mental processes. 
      It is for that reason that here express mention is made of &quot;one&#39;s own life 
      continuity&quot;. Having gathered the decisive direct experience from the 
      contemplation of his own body and mind, the meditator will later extend 
      the contemplation to the life-processes of others, by way of inference <I>
      (anumàna)</I>. See, in the Satipatthàna Sutta, the recurrent passage: 
      &quot;contemplating the body, etc., externally&quot;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[15]. <I>&quot;Noticing&quot; -- sallakkhana </I>is 
      a key term in this treatise. The corresponding verb in the Pàli language 
      is <I>sallakkheti (sam-lakh),</I> which can be translated, adequately as 
      well as literally, by &quot;to mark clearly&quot;. Though the use of &quot;to mark&quot; in 
      the sense of &quot;to observe&quot; or &quot;to notice&quot; is quite legitimate in English, 
      it is however somewhat unusual, and unwieldy in its derivations. Hence the 
      rendering by &quot;noticing&quot; was chosen. &quot;Noticing&quot; is identical with &quot;bare 
      attention&quot;, the term used in the translator&#39;s book &quot;The Heart of Buddhist 
      Meditations&quot; (London 1962, Rider &amp; Co.).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[16]. The Sub-commentary to the Brahmajàla 
      Sutta explains as follows: &quot;Things in their true nature <I>
      (paramattha-dhammà)</I> have twofold characteristics or marks: specific 
      characteristics and general characteristics. The understanding of the 
      specific characteristics is &#39;knowledge by experience&#39; <I>(paccakkha-nàna),</I> 
      while the understanding of the general characteristics is &#39;knowledge by 
      inference&#39; <I>(anumàna-nàna).&quot;</I> The specific characteristics, for 
      instance, of the Element of Motion <I>(vàyo-dhàtu) </I>are its nature of 
      supporting, its function of moving; its general characteristics are 
      impermanence, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[17]. The three terms printed in italics, 
      are standard categories of definition used in the Pàli commentaries and 
      the Visuddhi Magga. In the case of mental phenomena, a fourth category, 
      &quot;proximate condition&quot; <I>(padatthàna) </I>is added. The definition of the 
      Element of Motion (or of Wind) occurs, for instance, in the Visuddhi Magga 
      (tr. by Nànamoli Thera, p. 399), and is shown in this treatise to be a 
      fact of direct experience.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[18]. &#39;Purification of mind&#39; refers to 
      mental concentration of either of two degrees of intensity: Full 
      Concentration or Access Concentration (see Note 10). In both types of 
      concentration, the mind is temporarily purified from the five Mental 
      Hindrances (see Note 20), which defile the mind and obstruct 
      concentration. See also page 6.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[19]. The &quot;other&quot; objects may also belong 
      to the same series of events, for instance, the recurrent rise and fall of 
      the abdomen.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[20]. The five Mental Hindrances <I>
      (nìvarana) </I>which obstruct concentration, are: 1. sense-desire, 2. 
      ill-will, 3. sloth and torpor, 4. agitation and remorse, 5. sceptical 
      doubt. For details, see &quot;The Five Mental Hindrances and their Conquest&quot;,

      of the Visuddhi Magga.</FONT></P>

      Paramattha Manjusà, </I>the commentary to the Visuddhi-Magga, the former 
      term was used in Ceylon, the latter in India.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[27]. The ten Corruptions of Insight <I>
      (vipassanu pakkilesa) </I>are first mentioned in the <I>Patisambhidà Magga
      </I>(PTS, vol. ii, p. 100f) and are explained in the Visuddhi Magga (tr. 
      by Nànamoli Thera, p. 739). - The names and the sequence of the terms as

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[28]. The five grades of rapture (pìti),

      momentarily recurring, 3. flooding, 4. elevating, 5. suffusing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[29]. This passage refers to the six pairs 
      of qualitative factors of mental activity, which, according to the 
      Abhidhamma, are present in all moral consciousness though in different 
      degrees of development. The first pair is Tranquillity (a) of 
      consciousness, and (b) of its concomitant mental factors. The other pairs 
      are Agility, Pliancy, Wieldiness, Proficiency and Uprightness, all of 
      which have the same two-fold division as stated before. These six pairs 
      represent the formal, or structural, side of moral consciousness. For 
      details see <I>Abhidhamma Studies, </I>by Nyanaponika Thera (2nd ed., 
      Buddhist Publication Society), p.81 f.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[30]. These six obstructions of mind are 
      countered by the six pairs of mental factors mentioned in Note 29 and in 
      the following sentence of the text.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[31]. <I>Non-action, </I>non-activity or

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[37]<I>. Bhay-upatthàna. -- </I>The word
      <I>bhaya </I>has the subjective aspect of &#39;fear&#39; and the objective aspect 
      of &#39;fearfulness&#39;, &#39;danger&#39;. Both are included in the significance of the 
      term, in this context.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[38]. This refers to the knowledges 
      described in the following (Nos. 7 - 11).</FONT></P>

      nutritive essence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[40]. According to the Visuddhi Magga, the 
      &#39;Insight leading to Emergence&#39; is the culmination of Insight, and is 
      identical with the following three knowledges: Equanimity about 
      Formations, Desire for Deliverance, and Knowledge of Re-observation. It is 
      called &quot;Leading to Emergence&quot; because it emerges from the contemplation of 
      formations (conditioned phenomena) to the Supramundane Path that has 
      Nibbàna as its object.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[41]. The Visuddhi Magga says: &quot;The 
      Knowledge of Adaptation derives its name from the fact that it adapts 
      itself to the earlier and the later states of mind. It adapts itself to 
      the preceding eight insight knowledges with their individual functions, 
      and to the 37 states partaking of enlightenment that follow.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[42]<I>. Gotrabhu-nàna </I>(Maturity 
      Knowledge) is, literally, the &#39;knowledge of one who has become one of the 
      lineage <I>(gotra)&#39;. </I>By attaining to that knowledge, one has left 
      behind the designation and stage of an unliberated worldling and is 
      entering the lineage and rank of the Noble Ones, i.e., the Stream-enterer, 
      etc. Insight has now come to full maturity, that is, it matures into the 
      knowledge of the Supramundane Paths and Fruitions. Maturity Knowledge 
      occurs only as a single moment of consciousness; it does not recur, since 
      it is immediately followed by the Path consciousness of Stream-entry or 
      Once-returning, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[43]. &#39;Path Knowledge&#39; is the knowledge 
      connected with the four Supramundane Paths of Stream-entry, etc. Here, in 
      this passage, only the Path of Stream-entry is meant. Path Knowledge, like 
      Maturity Knowledge, lasts only for one moment of consciousness, being 
      followed by the Fruition Knowledge resulting from it, which may repeat 
      itself many times and may also be deliberately entered into, by way of the 
      &#39;Attainment of Fruition&#39; (see No. 17).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[44]. That means that Nibbàna has now 
      become an object of direct experience, and is no longer a mental construct 
      of conceptual thinking.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[45]. The knowledge of reviewing 
      defilements still remaining, does not obtain at the stage of Arahantship 
      where all defilemcnts have been eliminated. It may occur, but not 
      necessarily so, at the lower three stages of Stream-entry, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">[46]. See Note 43.</FONT></P>

      (indriya) </I>are: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom.
