      Calm and Insight</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What do we meditate on? How do we develop 
      insight? This is a very important question.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of meditation: 
      meditating to develop calm and meditating to develop insight. Meditating 
      on the ten devices only gives rise to calm, not insight. Meditating on the 
      ten foul things (a swollen corpse, for example), too, only gives rise to 
      calm, not insight. The ten recollections, like remembering the Buddha, the 
      Law and others, too, can develop calm and not insight. Meditating on the 
      thirty-two parts of the body like hair, nails, teeth, skin -- these too, 
      are not insight. They develop only concentration.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Mindfulness as to respiration is also 
      concentration-developing. But one can develop insight from it. <I>
      Visuddhi-Magga,</I> however, includes it in the concentration subjects and 
      so we will call it as such here.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then there are the four divine states, 
      love, pity, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, and four formless states 
      leading to formless <I>jhanas</I>. Then, there is the meditation on the 
      loathsomeness of food. All these are subjects for concentration 
      meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you meditate on the four elements 
      inside your body, it is called the analysis of the four elements. Although 
      this is a concentration meditation, it helps develop insight as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All these forty subjects of meditation are 
      subjects for developing concentration. Only respiration and analysis of 
      elements have to do with insight. The others will not give rise to 
      insight. If you want insight, you will have to work further.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To come back to our question, how do we 
      develop insight? The answer is: we develop insight by meditating on the 
      five aggregates of grasping. The mental and material qualities inside 
      beings are aggregates of grasping. They may be grasped with delight by 
      craving in which case it is called &quot;grasping of the sense objects&quot; -- or 
      they may be grasped wrongly by wrong views -- in which case it is called 
      &quot;grasping through wrong views.&quot; You have to meditate on them and see them 
      as they really are. If you don&#39;t, you will grasp them with craving and 
      wrong views. Once you see them as they are, you no longer grasp them. In 
      this way you develop insight. We will discuss the five aggregates of 
      grasping in detail.</FONT></P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>Aggregates</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The five aggregates of grasping are matter 
      or form, feelings, perception, volitional activities and consciousness. 
      What are they? They are the things you experience all the time. You do not 
      have to go anywhere else to find them. They are in you. When you see, they 
      are there in the seeing. When you hear, they are there in the hearing. 
      When you smell, taste, touch, or think, they are there in the smelling, 
      tasting, touching or thinking. When you bend, stretch or move your limbs, 
      the aggregates are there in the bending, stretching or moving. Only you do 
      not know them to be aggregates. It is because you have not meditated on 
      them and so do not know them as they really are. Not knowing them as they 
      are, you grasp them with craving and wrong view.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What happens when you bend? It begins with 
      the intention to bend. Then come the forms of bending one by one. Now in 
      the intention to bend there are the four mental aggregates. The mind that 
      intends to bend is the cons-ciousness. When you think of bending and then 
      bend, you may feel happy, or unhappy, or neither happy nor unhappy, doing 
      so. If you bend with happiness, there is pleasant feeling. If you bend 
      with unhappiness or anger, there is unpleasant feeling. If you bend with 
      neither happiness nor unhappiness, there is neutral feeling. So, when you 
      think of bending, there is the &quot;feeling&quot; aggregate. Then, there is 
      perception, the aggregate that recognizes the bending. Then there is the 
      mental state that urges you to bend. It seems as though it were saying 
      &quot;Bend! Bend!&quot; It is the volitional activities. Thus, in the intention to 
      bend you have feelings, perception, volitional activities and 
      consciousness -- all four mental aggregates. The movement of bending is 
      matter or form. It is the material aggregate. So, the intention to bend 
      and the bending together make up the five aggregates.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus, in one bending of the arm, there are 
      the five aggregates. You move once and the five aggregates come up. You 
      move again and there are more of the five aggregates. Every move calls up 
      the five aggregates. If you have not meditated on them rightly and have 
      not known them rightly, what happens we need not tell you. You know for 
      yourselves.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Well, you think &quot;I intend to bend&quot; and &quot;I 
      bend&quot;, don&#39;t you? Everybody does. Ask the children, they will give the 
      same answer. Ask adults who can&#39;t read and write, the same answer. Ask 
      someone who can read, the same answer still if he will say what he has in 
      his mind. But, because he is well-read, he may invent answers to suit the 
      scriptures and say &quot;Mind and matter.&quot; It is not what he knows for himself. 
      Only inventions to suit the scriptures. In his heart of hearts he is 
      thinking: &quot;It is I who intend to bend. It is I who bend. It is I who 
      intend to move. It is I who move.&quot; He also thinks: &quot;This I have been 
      before, am now, and will be in the future. I exist for ever.&quot; This 
      thinking is called the notion of permanence. Nobody thinks, &quot;This 
      intention to bend exists only now.&quot; Ordinary people always think, &quot;This 
      mind existed before. The same that have existed before am now thinking of 
      bending.&quot; They also think, &quot;This thinking I exist now and will go on 
      existing.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you bend or move the limbs, you 
      think: &quot;It is the same limbs that have existed that are moving now. It <B>
      is </B>the same I that have existed that am moving now.&quot; After moving you 
      again think, &quot;These limbs, this I, always exist.&quot; It never occurs to you 
      that they pass away. This, too, is the notion of permanence. It is 
      clinging to what is impermanent as permanent, clinging to what is no 
      personality, no ego, as personality, as ego.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then, as you have bent or stretched to 
      your desire, you think it is very nice. For example, as you feel stiffness 
      in the arm, you move or rearrange it and the stiffness is gone. You feel 
      comfortable. You think it is very nice. You think it is happiness. Dancers 
      and amateur dancers bend and stretch as they dance and think it is very 
      nice to do so. They delight in it and are pleased with themselves. When 
      you converse among yourselves you often shake your hands and heads and are 
      pleased. You think it is happiness. When something you are doing meets 
      with success, again you think it is good, it is happiness. This is how you 
      delight through craving and cling to things. What is impermanent you take 
      to be permanent and delight in. What is not happiness, not personality, 
      but just aggregates of mind and matter, you take to be happiness, or 
      personality, and delight in. You delight in them and cling to them. You 
      mistake them for self or ego and cling to them, too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, when you bend, stretch or move your 
      limbs, the thinking &quot;I will bend&quot; is aggregate of grasping. The bending is 
      the aggregate of grasping. The thinking &quot;I will stretch&quot; is the aggregate 
      of grasping. The stretching is the aggregate of grasping. The thinking &quot;I 
      will move&quot; is the aggregate of grasping. The moving is the aggregate of 
      grasping. When we speak of aggregates of grasping to be meditated on, we 
      mean just these things.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The same thing happens in seeing, hearing, 
      etc. When you see, the seat of seeing, the eye, is manifest. So is the 
      object seen. Both are material things. They cannot cognize. But if one 
      fails to meditate while seeing, one grasps them. One thinks the whole body 
      with the eye is permanent, happy, self, and grasps it. One thinks the 
      whole material world with the object seen is permanent, beautiful, good, 
      happy, and. self, and grasps it. So the form eye and the form visible 
      object are aggregates of grasping.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And when you see, the &quot;seeing&quot; is 
      manifest, too. It is the four mental aggregates. The mere awareness of 
      seeing is the aggregate consciousness. Pleasure or displeasure at seeing 
      is the aggregate feeling. What perceives the object seen is the aggregate 
      perception. What brings the attention to see is the aggregate volitional 
      activities. They constitute the four mental aggregates. If one fails to 
      meditate while seeing, one is inclined to think that seeing &quot;has existed 
      before, and exists now.&quot; Or<I>, </I>as one sees good things, one may think 
      &quot;seeing is good.&quot; So thinking, one goes after good and strange things to 
      enjoy seeing. One goes to watch plays and films at the expense of money, 
      sleep and health because one thinks it is good to do so. If one does not 
      think it is good, one will not go to waste money or impair one&#39;s health. 
      To think that what sees or enjoys is &quot;I&quot;, &quot;I am enjoying&quot;, is to grasp 
      with craving and wrong view. Because they grasp, the mind and matter that 
      manifest themselves in seeing are said to be aggregates of grasping.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You grasp in the same way in hearing, 
      smelling, tasting, touching or thinking. You grasp all the more to the 
      mind that thinks, imagines and reflects as being the &quot;I&quot;, the ego. So, the 
      five aggregates of grasping are none other than the mental-material things 
      that manifest themselves at the six doors whenever one sees, hears, feels 
      or perceives. You must try to see these aggregates as they are. To 
      meditate on them and see them as they are -- that is insight knowledge.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Insight meditation is meditating on the 
      five aggregates of grasping.&quot; This is in accordance with the teachings of 
      the Buddha. The teachings of the Buddha are called <I>suttas, </I>which 
      means &quot;thread.&quot; When a carpenter is about to plane down or saw off a piece 
      of timber he draws a straight line using a thread. In the same way when we 
      want to live the holy life we use the &quot;thread&quot; or <I>sutta </I>to<I> </I>
      draw straight lines in our actions. The Buddha has given us lines or 
      instructions on how to train in morality, develop concentration and make 
      become wisdom. You cannot go out of the line and speak or act as you 
      please. Regarding the meditation of the five aggregates, here are a few 
      excerpts from the suttas:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Material shape, monks, is impermanent. 
      What is impermanent, that is suffering. What is suffering, that is not the 
      self. What is not self, that is not mine, that am I not, this is not my 
      self. As it really comes to be, one should discern it thus by right 
      wisdom.&quot; -- </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Samyutta Nikaya ii 19</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You must meditate so that you will realize 
      this impermanent, suffering, not-self material form is really impermanent, 
      dreadfully suffering, and without a self or ego. You should meditate 
      likewise on feelings, perception, activities, and consciousness. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is the use of looking upon<B> </B>
      these aggregates as impermanent, suffering and not-self? </FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha tells us:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;So seeing all these things, the 
      instructed disciple of the Aryans disregards material shape, disregards 
      feeling.&quot; -- </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Samyutta Nikaya iii 
      68</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He who realizes the impermanent, 
      suffering, not-self nature of the five aggregates is wearied of material 
      form as he is of feelings, perception, activities and consciousness.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;By disregarding he is passionless.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That is to say, he has reached the Ariyan 
      Path.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Through passionlessness, he is freed.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once he has reached the Ariyan path of 
      passionlessness, he has arrived at the four fruitions of freedom from the 
      defilements, too.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;In freedom the knowledge comes to be &#39;I 
      am freed.&#39; &quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you are freed, you know for yourself 
      that you are so. In other words, when you have<B> </B>become an arahat in 
      whom the defilements are extinguished, you know you have become one.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All these excerpts are from <I>Yad anicca</I>
      <I>Sutta </I>and there are<B> </B>numerous suttas of this kind. The whole
      <I>Khandhavagga Samyutta </I>is a collection of them. Two suttas are 
      especially noteworthy: <I>Silavanta Sutta</I> and<I> Sutavanta Sutta. </I>
      In both suttas the venerable Maha Kotthika puts some questions to the 
      venerable Sariputta, who gives very brief but vivid answers. Maha Kotthika 
      asks:</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;What things, friend Sariputta, should be 
      attended to thoroughly by a monk of moral habit?&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Note the attribute &quot;of moral habit&quot; in 
      this question. If you want to practise insight meditation with a view to 
      attaining the Path and Fruition and Nirvana, the least qualification you 
      need is to be of moral habit. If you don &#39;t even have moral habit, you 
      can&#39;t hope for the higher conditions of concentration and wisdom. The 
      Venerable. Sariputta answers:</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The five grasping aggregates, friend 
      Kotthika, are the things which should be thoroughly attended to by a monk 
      of moral habit, as being impermanent, suffering, as a disease, as a boil, 
      as a dart, as pain, as illness, as alien, as decay, as void, as not-self.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is the good of meditating like that? 
      In answer the Venerable Sariputta goes on, </FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Indeed, friend, it is possible for a monk 
      of moral habit so thoroughly attending to these five aggregates of 
      grasping&quot;</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> to realize the fruits of 
      stream-winning.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, if you want to be a<B> </B>stream 
      winner and never to be reborn in the four lower states, you have to 
      meditate on the five aggregates to realize their impermanence, suffering, 
      and not-self nature. But that is not all. You can become an Arahat, too. 
      The venerable Kotthika goes on to ask,</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;What things, friend Sariputta, should be 
      attended to thoroughly by a monk who is a Stream-winner?&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Venerable Sariputta answers that it is 
      the same five aggregates of grasping that should be thoroughly attended to 
      by a stream-winner, as impermanent, suffering, not-self. The result? He 
      moves on to Once-returning. What does Once-returner meditate on? Again the 
      same five aggregates of grasping. He then becomes a Non-returner. What 
      does the Non-returner meditate on? The five aggregates again. Now he 
      becomes an Arahat. What does the Arahat meditate on? The five aggregates 
      again. From this it is clear that the five aggregates are the things one 
      has to meditate on even when one has become an Arahat.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What good is it to the Arahat by 
      meditating so? Will he become a silent Buddha? Or, a supreme Buddha? No, 
      neither. He will end his round of rebirths as an Arahat and enter Nirvana. 
      The Arahat has no defilement left unremoved or uncalmed yet. All the 
      defilements have been removed and calmed. So, he has nothing to develop in 
      order to remove the defilements left unremoved or to calm those left 
      uncalmed. Neither has he any moral habit, con-centration or wisdom yet to 
      perfect. All the moral habits, concentration and wisdom that ought to be 
      perfected have been perfected in him. So, he has no need to work for the 
      perfection of what ought to be perfected, nor has he any need to increase 
      those already perfected. The insight practice brings no such benefits to 
      the Arahat.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One of the benefits the Arahat receives by 
      meditating on the five aggregates is the happy condition in this world. 
      Notwithstanding his being an Arahat, if he remains without meditation, 
      disquiet and discomfort keep coming up at the six sense-doors, now here, 
      now there. Here, disquiet does not mean mental distress. As the 
      sense-objects keep coming up despite himself, he finds no peace of mind. 
      That is all. Not to speak of Arahats, our meditators of today feel ill at 
      ease to meet with the sense-objects, eager though they are on insight. As 
      they return home from the meditation centre, they see this thing, hear 
      that thing, get engaged in such and such business talks, and there is no 
      peace at all. So they come back to the centre. To some, however, the 
      disquiet does not last very long. Just four, five or ten days. Very soon 
      the homely spirit gets the better of them and they are happy with their 
      home life and set to household cares again. The arahat never returns to 
      his old habits. If he meets with various sense-objects without meditation, 
      only disquiet results. Only when he is absorbed in insight meditation does 
      he find peace of mind. Thus meditating on the five grasping aggregates 
      brings to the Arahat a happy condition in this world.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Again, as he lives in earnest meditation, 
      mindfulness and comprehension of the impermanence, suffering and not-self 
      keep rising in him. This is another benefit. The Arahat in whom 
      mindfulness and comprehension keep rising is said to be in a chronic state 
      of<I> </I>life. Such a one can enjoy the attainment to fruition at any 
      time and for as long as he desires. For these two benefits -- a happy 
      condition in this world and mindfulness-comprehension -- the Arahat lives 
      in meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The above are the answers given by the 
      venerable Sariputta in <I>Silavanta Sutta. </I>The same answers are found 
      in <I>Sutavanta Sutta</I> too. The only difference is in the terms <I>
      silavanta,</I> &quot;of moral habit&quot; or &quot;virtuous&quot;, and<I> sutavanta,</I> 
      &quot;instructed&quot; or &quot;well informed.&quot; All the other words are the same. Based 
      on these two suttas and other suttas on the aggregate the dictum has been 
      formulated: </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Insight knowledge comes 
      from meditating on the five aggregates of grasping.</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now to come back to the grasping that 
      rises through the six sense-doors.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When people see, they think of themselves 
      or others as being permanent, as having existed before, as existing now, 
      as going to exist in future, as existing always. They think of them as 
      being happy, good, or beautiful. They think of them as being living 
      entities. They think likewise when they hear, smell, taste or touch. This 
      &quot;touch&quot; is widespread all over the body -- wherever there is flesh and 
      blood. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And wherever touch arises, there arises 
      grasping. The bending, stretching, or moving of the limbs mentioned 
      earlier are all instances of touch. So are the tense movements of rising 
      and falling in the abdomen. We will come to this in detail later.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When one thinks or imagines, one thinks, 
      &quot;The I that have existed before is now thinking. Thinking, I go on 
      existing,&quot; and so one thinks of oneself as being permanent, as an ego. One 
      also thinks the thinking or imagining as being enjoyable, as being very 
      nice. One thinks it is happiness. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If told that the thinking will disappear, 
      he cannot accept it. He is not pleased. This is because he is clinging to 
      it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this way one clings to whatever comes 
      through the six sense doors, as being permanent, as being happy, as ego, 
      as self. One delights with craving and clings to it. One mistakes with 
      wrong view and clings to it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You have to meditate on the five 
      aggregates that can cling or grasp.</FONT></P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>The Right Method</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you meditate, you have to meditate 
      with method. Only the right method can bring about insight. If you look 
      upon <U>t</U>hings as being permanent, how can there be insight? If you 
      look<B> </B>upon them as being happy, beautiful, as soul, as ego, how can 
      there be insight?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Mind and matter are impermanent things. 
      These impermanent things you have to meditate on to see them as they 
      really are, as being impermanent. They rise and pass away and keep on 
      oppressing you, so they are dreadful, they are sufferings. You have to 
      meditate to see them as they are, as sufferings. They are processes 
      lacking in a personality, a soul, a self. You have to meditate to see that 
      there is no personality, no soul, no self. You must try to see them as 
      they really are.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, every time you see, hear, touch or 
      perceive, you must try to see the mental and material processes that rise 
      through the six sense doors as they really are. When you see, the<B> </B>
      seeing is real. This you must note <I>seeing, seeing. </I>In the same way 
      when you hear, note <I>hearing. </I>When you smell, note <I>smelling. </I>
      When you taste, note <I>tasting. </I>When you touch, note <I>touching. </I>
      Tiredness, hotness, aches, and such unbearable and unpleasant sensations 
      arise from contact too. Observe them: <I>tiredness, hot, pain, </I>and so 
      on. Thoughts, ideas, may also turn up. Note them: <I>thinking, imagining, 
      pleasure, delight,</I> as they arise. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But to the novice it is hard to observe 
      all that come up through the six sense doors. He must begin with just a 
      few.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You meditate like this. When you breathe 
      in and out, the way the abdomen moves rising and falling is especially 
      conspicuous. You begin observing this move-ment. The movement of rising 
      you observe as<I> rising. </I>The movement of falling you observe as <I>
      falling. </I>This observation of rising and falling is void of the lingo 
      of the scriptures. People who are not used to meditational practice speak 
      of it in contempt: &quot;This rising and falling business has nothing to do 
      with the scriptures. It is nothing.&quot; Well may they think it is nothing 
      because it is not done up in scriptural jargon.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Theoretically, however, it <I>is </I>
      something. The rising is real, the falling is real, the moving air element 
      is real. We have used the colloquial words <I>rising </I>and<I> falling
      </I>for convenience&#39;s sake. In scriptural terminology, the rising-falling 
      is the air-element. If you observe the abdomen attentively as it rises and 
      falls, the firmness is there, the motion is there, the bringing out is 
      there. Here, the &quot;firmness&quot; is the characteristic of the air-element, the 
      motion is its property, and the bringing out is its manifestation. To know 
      the air-element as it really is means to know its characteristic, property 
      and manifes-tation. We meditate to know them. Insight begins with the 
      determination of mind and matter. To achieve this the meditator begins 
      with the matter. How?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;(The meditator) should.... seize by way 
      of characteristic, function and so on.&quot; -- Visuddhi-magga ii 227</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you begin meditating on matter or 
      mind, you should do so by way of either the characteristic or the property 
      (function). &quot;And so on&quot; refers to the manifesta-tion (mode of appearance). 
      In this connection the Compendium of Philosophy is quite to the point.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Purity of view is the understanding of 
      mind and matter with respect to their characteristics, function 
      (property), mode of appearance (manifestation) and proximate cause.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meaning is this: insight begins with 
      the analytical knowledge of mind and matter. In the seven purities, first 
      you perfect the purity of morals and the purity of mind, and then you 
      begin the purity of views. To achieve the analytical knowledge of mind and 
      matter and the purity of views, you have to meditate on mind and matter 
      and know them by way of their characteristics, property (function), 
      manifestation and proximate cause. Once you know them thus, you gain the 
      analytical knowledge of mind and matter. Once this knowledge grows 
      sharper, you develop the purity of views.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Here, &quot;to know them by way of their 
      characteristics&quot; means to know the intrinsic nature of mind and matter. To 
      know &quot;by way of property&quot; is to know their function. Manifestation is 
      their mode of appearance. It is not yet necessary to know the proximate 
      cause at the initial stage of meditational practice. So we will just go on 
      to explain the characteristics, function and manifestation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In both the <I>Path of Purity </I>and the
      <I>Compendium of Philosophy </I>just quoted it is not indicated that mind 
      and matter should be meditated on by name, by number, as material 
      particles or as incessantly coming up processes. It is only shown that 
      they should be meditated on by way of their characteristics, function and 
      manifestation. One should take careful note of this. If not, one can be 
      led to concepts of names, numbers, particles or processes. The 
      commentaries say that you should meditate on mind and matter by way of 
      their characteristic, function and manifestation, and so when you meditate 
      on the air element, you do so by way of its characteristic, function and 
      manifestation. What is the characteristic of the<B> </B>air-element? It is 
      the characteristic of support. This is its intrinsic nature. It is the air 
      element itself. What is the function of the air-element? It is moving. 
      What is its manifestation? It is bringing out. Manifestation is what 
      appears to the meditator&#39;s intellect. As one meditates on the air-element, 
      it appears to the meditator&#39;s intellect as something bringing out, 
      pushing, and pulling. This is the manifestation of the air-element. As<B>
      </B>you meditate on the rising-falling of the abdomen, all the firmness, 
      moving, bringing out, become clear to you. These are the characteristic, 
      function and manifestation of the air-element. This air element is 
      important. In the postures and comprehension, contemplation of the body,
      <I>Satipatthana</I>-<I>sutta</I>, the commentator has laid emphasis on the 
      air-element. Here is the Buddha&#39;s teaching:</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Gacchanto va gacchami ti pajanati</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">.<I>&quot;</I>
      <BR>
      (When he walks, he is aware &quot;I am walking.&quot;)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha is instructing us to be mindful 
      of the form walking by noting <I>walking, walking, </I>every time we walk.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How knowledge is developed from meditating 
      thus is explained by the commentator:</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The thought I am walking arises. This 
      produces air. The air produces the intimation. The bringing forward of the 
      whole body as the air-element spreads is said to be walking.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meaning is this: The meditator who is 
      used to meditating -- <I>walking, walking,</I> every time he walks 
      realizes like this. First the idea &quot;I will walk&quot; arises. This intention 
      gives rise to tense movement all over the body, which in turn causes the 
      material body to move forward move by move. This we say &quot;I walk,&quot; or &quot;He 
      walks.&quot; In reality there is no I or He that walks. Only the intention to 
      walk and the form walking. This the meditator realizes. Here, in this 
      explanation of the Commentary, the emphasis is on the realization of the 
      moving of the air-element. So, if you understand the air-element by way of 
      its characteristics, function and manifestation, you can decide for 
      yourself whether your meditation is right or not.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The air-element has the characteristic of 
      support. In a football it is air that fills and supports so that the ball 
      expands and remains firm. In colloquial speech we say the ball is full and 
      firm. In philosophical terms the air-element is in support. When you 
      stretch your arm you feel some stiffness there. It is the air-element in 
      support. In the same way when you press an air-pillow or mattress with 
      your body or head, your body or head will not come down but stay high 
      above. It is because the air clement in the pillow or mattress is 
      supporting you. Bricks pile up as the ones below support those above. If 
      the bricks below are not supporting, the ones above will tumble down. In 
      the same way the human body is full of the air-element which gives support 
      to it so that it can stand stiff and firm. We say &quot;firm&quot; relatively. If 
      there is something firmer, we will call it &quot;lax&quot;. If there is something 
      more lax, it becomes firm again.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The function of the air-element is moving. 
      It moves from place to place when it is strong. It is the air-element that 
      makes the body bend, stretch, sit, rise, go or come. Those unpractised in 
      insight meditation often say, &quot;If you note <I>bending,</I> <I>stretching,
      </I>only concepts like arms will appear to you. If you note <I>left, 
      right, </I>only concepts like legs will appear to you. If you note <I>
      rising, falling, </I>only concepts like the abdomen will appear to you.&quot; 
      This may be true to some of the beginners. But it is not true to think 
      that the concepts will keep coming up. Both concepts and realities appear 
      to the beginner. Some people instruct the beginners to meditate on 
      realities only. This is impossible. To forget concepts is quite 
      impracticable at the beginning. You must combine concepts with realities. 
      The Buddha himself used concepts and told us to be &quot;aware &#39;I am walking&#39; &quot; 
      when we walk, bend or stretch. He did not use realities and tell us to be 
      &quot;aware &#39;It is supporting, moving&#39;,&quot; etc. Although you meditate using the 
      language of concepts like &quot;walking, bending, stretching,&quot; as your 
      mindfulness and concentration grow stronger, all the concepts disappear 
      and only the realities like support and moving appear to you. When you 
      reach the stage of the knowledge of dissolution, although you meditate <I>
      walking, walking,</I> neither the legs nor<B> </B>the body appear to you. 
      Only the movement itself is there. Although you meditate <I>bending, 
      bending,</I> there will not be any arms or legs. Only the movement. 
      Although you meditate <I>rising, falling, </I>there will be no image of 
      the abdomen or the body. Only the movement out and in. These as well as 
      swaying are functions of the air-element.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What appears to be bringing out or drawing 
      in to the meditator&#39;s mind is the manifestation of the air-element. When 
      you bend or stretch your arm, it appears, something is drawing it in or 
      pushing it out. It is plainer when walking. To the meditator whose 
      concentration is grown sharper, by noting <I>walking, right step, left</I>
      <I>step, lifting, putting forward, putting down,</I> this moving forward 
      as if being driven from behind becomes quite plain. The legs seem to be 
      pushing forward of their own accord. How they move forward without the 
      meditator making any effort is very plain. It is so good walking noting 
      like this that some spend a<B> </B>lot of time in it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, when you meditate on the air element, 
      you should know it by way of its characteristic of supporting, its 
      function of moving, and its manifestation of bringing out. Only then is 
      your knowledge right and as it should be.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You may ask, &quot;Are we to meditate only 
      after learning the characteristic, function and manifestation?&quot; No. You 
      need not learn them. If you meditate on the rising mind-and-matter, you 
      know the characteristic, the function, and the manifestation as well. 
      There is no other way than knowing by way of the characteristic, function, 
      and manifestation when you meditate on the rising mind-and-matter. When 
      you look up to the sky on a rainy day you see a flash of lightning. This 
      bright light is the characteristic of the lightning. As lightning flashes, 
      darkness is dispelled. This dispelling of darkness is the functions of 
      lightning, its work. You also see what it is like -- whether it is long, 
      short, a curve, a circle, straight, or vast. You see its characteristic, 
      its function, its manifesta-tion, all at once. Only you may not be able to 
      say the brightness is its characteristic, dispelling of darkness is its 
      function, or its shape or outline is its manifestation. But you see them 
      all the same.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the same way, when you meditate on the 
      rising mind-and-matter, you know its characteristic, its function, its 
      manifestation, everything. You need not learn them. Some learned persons 
      think that you have to learn them before you meditate. Not so. What you 
      learn are only concepts. Not realities. The meditator who is contemplating 
      the rising mind-and-matter knows them as if he were touching them with his 
      own hand. He needs not learn about them. If there is the elephant before 
      your very eyes, you need not look at the picture of an elephant.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditator who is meditating on the 
      rising and falling of the abdomen knows the firmness or laxity thereof -- 
      its characteristic. He knows the moving in or out -- its function. He also 
      knows its bringing in and pushing out --its manifestation. If he knows 
      these things as they really are, does he need to learn about them? Not if 
      he wants the realization for himself. But if he wants to preach to others, 
      he will need to learn about them. When you meditate <I>right step, left 
      step,</I> you know the tenseness in every step -- its characteristic. You 
      know the moving about-- its function. And you know its bringing out -- its 
      manifestation. This is proper knowledge, the right knowledge.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now, to know for yourselves how one can 
      discern the characteristic and so on by just meditating on what rises, try 
      doing some meditation. You certainly have some hotness, pain, tiredness, 
      ache, somewhere in your body now. These are unpleasant feelings hard to 
      bear. Concentrate on this unpleasantness with your<B> </B>intellect and 
      note <I>hot, hot, </I>or<I> pain, pain. </I>You will find<B> </B>that you 
      are going through an unpleasant experience and suffering. This is the 
      characteristic of suffering -- going through an unplea-sant experience.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When this unpleasant feeling comes about, 
      you become low-spirited. If the unpleasantness is little, there is a 
      little low-spiritedness. If it is great, then low-spiritedness is great 
      too. Even those who are of a strong will have their spirits go low if the 
      unpleasant feelings are intense. Once you are very tired, you can&#39;t even 
      move. This making the spirit go low is the function of unpleasant feeling. 
      We have said &quot;spirit&quot;-- the mind. When the mind is low, its concomitants 
      get low too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The manifestation of unpleasant feeling is 
      physical oppression. It manifests itself as a physical affliction, 
      something unbearable to the meditator&#39;s intellect. As he meditates <I>hot, 
      hot, pain, pain, </I>it comes up to him as something oppressing in the 
      body, something very hard to bear. It shows up so much that you have to 
      groan. If you meditate on the unpleasant feeling in your body as it rises, 
      you know the undergoing of undesirable tangible object its characteristic, 
      the waning of associated states -- its function, and the physical 
      affliction -- its manifestation. This is the way the meditators gain 
      knowledge.</FONT></P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>The Mind</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You can meditate on mind, too. Mind 
      cognizes and thinks. So what thinks and imagines is mind. Meditate on this 
      mind as <I>thinking, imagining, pondering, </I>whenever it arises. You 
      will find that it has the intrinsic nature of going to the object, 
      cognizing the object. This is the characteristic of mind, as it is said, 
      &quot;Mind has the characteristic of cognizing.&quot; Every kind of mind cognizes. 
      The conscious-ness of seeing cognizes the object, as do the consciousness 
      of hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you work in collective, you have a 
      leader. Consciousness is the leader that cognizes the object that appears 
      at any sense door. When the visible object comes<B> </B>up to the eye, 
      consciousness cognizes it first of all. It is then followed by feeling, 
      perception, desire, delight, dislike, admiration and so on. In the same 
      way, when the audible object comes up to the ear, it is consciousness that 
      cognizes it first. It is more obvious when you think or imagine. If an 
      idea comes up while you are meditating <I>&quot;rising&quot;, &quot;falling&quot;</I> etc, you 
      have to note the idea. If you can note it the moment it appears, it 
      disappears immediately. If you can&#39;t, several of its followers like 
      delight, desire, will come in succession. Then the meditator realizes how 
      consciousness is the leader -- its function.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Mind precedes things.&quot;</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> 
      --Dhammapada</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you note consciousness whenever it 
      rises, you see very clearly how it is acting as leader, now going to this 
      object now going to that object.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Again it is said in the commentary: 
      &quot;Consciousness has the manifestation of continuity.&quot; As you meditate <I>
      rising, falling,</I> etc., the mind sometimes wanders away. You note it 
      and it disappears. Then another consciousness comes up. You note it and it 
      disappears. Again another consciousness appears. Again you note it and 
      again it disappears. Again another comes up. You have to note lots of such 
      comings up and goings away of consciousness. The meditator comes to 
      realize: &quot;Consciousness is a succession of events that come up and go away 
      one after another. When one disappears, another appears.&quot; Thus you realize 
      the continuous manifestation of consciousness. The meditator who realizes 
      this also realizes death and birth. &quot;Death is nothing strange after all. 
      It is just like the passing away of the consciousness I have been noting. 
      To be born again is like the coming up of the consciousness I am now 
      noting that has risen in continuation of the one preceding it&quot;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To show that one can understand the 
      characteristic, function and manifestation of things even though one has 
      not learnt about them, we have taken the air-element out of the material 
      qualities and the unpleasant feeling and consciousness out of the mental 
      qualities. You just have to meditate on them as they arise. The same 
      applies to all the other mental and material qualities. If you meditate on 
      them as they arise, you will understand their characteristics, function 
      and manifestation. The beginner in meditation can meditate on and 
      understand the mental-material aggregates of grasping only by way of these 
      characteristics, function and manifestation. At the initial stage with the 
      analytical knowledge of mind and matter and the knowledge by discerning 
      conditionality, which are elemental in insight meditation, understanding 
      that much is enough. When you come to real insight knowledges like the 
      knowledge of investigation, you know the characteristics, impermanence, 
      suffering, and not self as well.</FONT></P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>What time?</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The question now arises: What do we 
      meditate on the grasping aggregates for? And, as regards time, what time 
      do we meditate on, the past, the future, the present, or indefinite time?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What do we meditate for? Do we meditate on 
      the aggregates of grasping for worldly wealth? For relief from illness? 
      For clairvoyance? For levitation and such supernatural powers? Insight 
      meditation aims at none of these. There have been cases of people who get 
      cured of serious illnesses as a result of meditational practice. In the 
      days of the Buddha persons who got perfected through insight meditation 
      had supernatural powers. People today may have such powers if they get 
      perfected. But fulfilment of these powers is <I>not </I>the basic aim of 
      insight meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Shall we meditate on phenomena past and 
      gone? Shall we meditate on phenomena not yet come? Shall we meditate on 
      the present phenomena? Or, shall we meditate on phenomena which are 
      neither past, future, nor present, but which we can imagine as we have 
      read about them in books?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The answer to these questions is: we 
      meditate to not grasp and we meditate on what is arising.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Yes, people not practised in meditation 
      grasp at the rising mind-and-matter every time they see, hear, touch, or 
      become aware of. They grasp at them with craving – are pleased with them. 
      They grasp at them with wrong views, as permanent, happy, as the I, the 
      ego. We meditate in order not to let these graspings arise, to be free 
      from them. This is the basic aim of insight meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And we meditate on what is arising. We do 
      not meditate on things past, future, or indefinite in time. Here we are 
      speaking of practical insight meditation. In inferential meditation we do 
      meditate on things past, future, and indefinite in time. Let me explain. 
      Insight meditation is of two kinds, practical and inferential. The 
      knowledge you gain by meditating on what actually arises by way of 
      characteristic, function and manifestation is practical insight. From this 
      practical knowledge you infer the impermanence, suffering and not-self of 
      things past and future, things you have not experienced. This is 
      inferential insight.</FONT></P>

      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Visuddhi-magga</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The object seen&quot;-- this is practical 
      insight. And &quot;going after the object seen ... determining both ... in the 
      past ... in the future&quot; -- this is inferential insight. But here note: the 
      inferential insight is possible only after the practical. No inference can 
      be made without first knowing the present. The same explanation is given 
      in the commentary on </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Kathavatthu.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Seeing the impermanence of even one 
      formation, one draws the conclusion as regards the others, as &#39;impermanent 
      are all the things of life&#39;.&quot;</FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Why don&#39;t we meditate on things past or 
      future? Because they will not make you understand the real nature and 
      cleanse you of defilements. You do not remember your past existences. Even 
      in this existence, you do not remember most of your childhood. So, 
      meditating on things past, how can you know things as they really are with 
      their characteristics and functions? Things of the more recent past may be 
      recalled. But, as you recall them, you think, &quot;I saw, I heard, I thought. 
      It was I who saw at that time and it is I who am seeing now.&quot; There is the 
      &quot;I&quot; notion for you. There can even be notions of permanence and happiness. 
      So recalling things past to meditate on do not serve our purpose, You have 
      grasped them and this grasping is hard to overcome. Although you look on<B>
      </B>them as mind and matter with all your learning and thinking, the &quot;I&quot; 
      notion persists, because you have already grasped it. You say 
      &quot;impermanent&quot; on the one hand, you get the notion &quot;permanent&quot; on the 
      other. You note <I>suffering, </I>but the notion &quot;happiness&quot; keeps turning 
      up. You meditate on <I>not-self,</I> but the self notion remains strong 
      and firm. You argue with yourself. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the end your meditation has to give way 
      to your preconceived ideas.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The future has not yet come, and you can&#39;t 
      be sure what exactly it will be like when it comes. You may have meditated 
      on them in advance but may fail to do so when they turn up. Then will 
      craving, wrong view, and defilements arise all anew. So, to meditate on 
      the future with the help of learning and thinking is no way to know things 
      as they really are. Nor is it the way to calm defilements.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Things of indefinite time have never 
      existed, will not exist, and are not existing, in oneself or in others. 
      They are just imagined by learning and thinking. They are high-sounding 
      and look intellectual, but on reflection are found to be just concepts of 
      names, signs and shapes. Suppose someone is meditating, &quot;Matter is 
      impermanent. Matter rises moment to moment and passes away moment to 
      moment.&quot; Ask him: What matter is it? Is it matter of the past or the 
      present or the future? Matter in oneself or in others? If in oneself, is 
      it matter in the head? The body? The limbs? The eye? The ear? You will 
      find that it is none of these but a mere concept, an imagination. So we do 
      not meditate on indefinite time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But the present phenomenon is what comes 
      up at the six doors right now. It has not yet been defiled. It is like an 
      unsoiled piece of cloth or paper. If you are quick enough to meditate on 
      it just as it comes up, it will not be defiled. You fail to note it and it 
      gets defiled. Once defiled, it cannot be undefiled. If you fail to note 
      the mind-and-matter as it rises, grasping intervenes. There is grasping 
      with craving -- grasping of sense-desires. There is grasping with wrong 
      view -- grasping of wrong views, of mere rite and ritual, of a theory of 
      the self. What if grasping takes place?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Grasping is no small matter. It is the 
      root-cause of good and bad deeds. One who is grasped works to accomplish 
      what he believes are good things. Everyone of us is doing what he thinks 
      is good.What makes him think it is good? It is grasping. Others may think 
      it is bad, but to the doer it is good. If he thinks it is not good, of 
      course he will not do it. There is a noteworthy passage in King Asoka&#39;s 
      inscriptions: &quot;One thinks well of one&#39;s work. One never thinks evil of 
      one&#39;s work.&quot; A thief steals because it is good to him to steal. A robber 
      robs people because he thinks it is good to rob. A killer kills because he 
      thinks it is good to kill. Ajatasattu killed his own father, King 
      Bimbisara. He thought it was good. Devadatta conspired against the life of 
      the Buddha. Why, to him it was good. One who takes poison to kill himself 
      does so because he thinks it is good. Moths rush to a flame thinking it is 
      a<B> </B>very nice thing. All living things do what they do because they 
      think it is good to do so. To think it is good is grasping. Once you are 
      really<B> </B>grasped you do things. What is the outcome? Well, it is the 
      good deeds and the bad deeds.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is a good deed to refrain from causing 
      suffering to others. It is a good deed to render help to others. It is a 
      good deed to give. It is a good deed to pay respect to those to whom 
      respect is due. A good deed can bring about peace, a long life, and good 
      health in this very life. It will<I> </I>bring good results in future 
      lives, too. Such grasping is good, right grasping. Those who are thus 
      grasped do good deeds like giving and keeping precepts and cause thereby 
      to bring about good karma. What is the result then? &quot;Conditioned by 
      becoming is birth.&quot; After death they are born anew. Where are they born? 
      In the Good Born, in the worlds of men and gods. As men they are endowed 
      with such good things as a long life, beauty, health, as well as good 
      birth, good following, and wealth. You can call them &quot;happy people.&quot; As 
      gods, too, they will be attended by multitudes of gods and goddesses and 
      be living in magnificent palaces. They have been<B> </B>grasped by notions 
      of happiness and in a worldly sense, they can be said to be happy.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But from the point of view of the Buddha&#39;s 
      teaching, these happy men and gods are<B> </B>not exempt from suffering. 
      &quot;Conditioned by birth are old age and dying.&quot; Although born a happy man, 
      he will have to grow into an old &quot;happy&quot; man. Look at all those &quot;happy&quot; 
      old people in this world. Once over seventy or eighty, not everything is 
      all right with them. Grey hair, broken teeth, poor eye-sight, poor 
      hearing, backs bent double, wrinkles all over, energy all spent up, mere 
      good-for-nothings! With all their wealth and big names, these old men and 
      women, can they be happy? Then there is the disease of old age. They 
      cannot sleep well, they cannot eat well, they have difficulty sitting down 
      or getting up. And finally, they must die. Rich man, king, or man of 
      power, dies one day. He has nothing to rely on then. Friends and relatives 
      there are around him, but just as he is lying there on his death-bed he 
      closes his eyes and dies. Dying he goes away all alone to another 
      existence. He must find it really hard to part with all his wealth. If he 
      is not a man of good deeds he will be worried about his future existence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The great god, likewise, has to die. Gods 
      too are not spared. A week before they die, five signs appear to them. The 
      flowers they wear which never faded now begin to fade. Their dresses which 
      never got worn-out now appear worn-out. Sweat comes out in their armpits, 
      an unusual thing. Their bodies which always looked young now look old. 
      Having never felt bored in their divine lives, they now feel bored. When 
      these five signs appear, they at once realize their imminent death, and 
      are greatly alarmed. In the days of the Buddha, the Sakka, (King<I> </I>of<I>
      </I>the gods) himself had these signs appear to him. Greatly alarmed that 
      he was going to die and lose his glory, he came to the Buddha for help. 
      The Buddha preached the <I>dhamma </I>to him and he became a 
      stream-winner. The old Sakka died and a new Sakka was reborn. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It was lucky of him that the Buddha was 
      there to save him. Had it not been for the Buddha, it would have been a 
      disaster to the old great god.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Not only old age and dying &quot;... grief, 
      suffering, sorrow, despair and lamentation come into being.&quot; All these are 
      sufferings. &quot;Thus comes to be the origination of this entire mass of ill.&quot; 
      So, the good life resulting from grasping is dreadful suffering after all. 
      Men or gods, all have to suffer.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If the good life resulting from good deeds 
      is suffering, had we better not do them? No. If we do not do good deeds, 
      bad deeds may come up. These can lead us to hell, to the realm of animals, 
      to the realm of ghosts. The sufferings of these lower planes are far 
      worse. Human and divine life is suffering compared with the happiness of 
      deathless Nirvana but compared with the sufferings of the lower states, 
      human or divine life is happiness indeed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Right grasping gives rise to good deeds. 
      Likewise wrong grasping gives<B> r</B>ise to bad deeds. Thinking that it 
      is good to do so, some kill, steal, rob, do wrong to others. As a result 
      they are reborn in bad bourn -- in hell, in the realm of animals, in the 
      realm of ghosts. To be reborn in hell is like jumping into a great fire. 
      Even a great god can do nothing against hell fire. In the days of the 
      Buddha there was a great mara-god by the name of Dusi. He was contemptuous 
      of the Buddha and the members of the holy Order. One day he caused the 
      death of an arahat. As a result of this cruel deed the great god died and 
      was reborn in Avici hell. Once there he was at the mercy of the guardians 
      of purgatory. Those people who are bullying others in this world will meet 
      the same fate as that met by the great god Dusi one day. Then, after 
      suffering for a long time in hell, they will be reborn animals and ghosts.</FONT></P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000" FACE="Times New Roman"><B>
      <P>How grasping arises</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So grasping is dreadful. It is very 
      important too. We meditate to let this grasping not be, to put an end to 
      it. We meditate not to grasp with craving or wrong view, not to grasp as 
      permanent or happy, not to grasp as self, ego, the I. Those who fail to 
      meditate grasp whenever they see, hear, feel or perceive. Ask yourselves 
      if you don&#39;t grasp. The answer will be too obvious.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let&#39;s begin with seeing. Suppose you see 
      something beautiful. What do you think of it? You are delighted with it, 
      pleased with it, aren&#39;t you? You won&#39;t say, &quot;I don&#39;t want to see, I don&#39;t 
      want to look at it.&quot; In fact, you are thinking, &quot;What a beautiful thing! 
      How lovely!&quot; Beaming with smiles you are pleased with it. At the same time 
      you are thinking it is permanent. Whether the object seen is a human being 
      or an inanimate thing, you think it has existed before, exists now, and 
      will go on existing for ever. Although it is not your own, you mentally 
      take possession of it and delight in it. If it is a piece of clothing, you 
      mentally put it on and are pleased. If it is a pair of sandals, you 
      mentally put them on. If it is a human being, you mentally use him or her 
      and are pleased, too. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The same thing happens when you hear, 
      smell, taste or touch. You take pleasure on each occasion. With thoughts 
      the range of your delights is far wider. You fancy and take delight in 
      things not your own, long for them, and imagine them to be yours. If they 
      are your own things, needless to say, you keep thinking of them and are 
      pleased with them all the time. We meditate to check such taking delights 
      in and graspings. We grasp with wrong views, too. You grasp with the 
      personality view. When you see, you think what you see is a person, an 
      ego. Your own consciousness of seeing, too, you take as a person, an ego. 
      Without a thorough insight knowledge we grasp at things the moment we see 
      them. Think of yourselves and you will see for yourselves how you have got 
      such grasping in you. You think of yourself as well as of others as an ego 
      that has lived the whole life long. In reality there is no such thing. 
      Nothing lives the whole life long. Only mind and matter rising one after 
      another in continuation. This mind-and-matter you take as person, ego, and 
      grasp. We meditate to not let these graspings with wrong views be.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But we have to meditate on things as they 
      come up. Only then will we be able to prevent the graspings. Graspings 
      come from seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and thinking. They 
      come from six places -- six doors. Can we cling to things we cannot see? 
      No. Can we cling to those we cannot hear? No. The Buddha himself has asked 
      these questions.</FONT></P>
      <I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Now what think you, Malunkya&#39;s son? As to 
      those shapes cognizable by eye, which you have not seen, which you have 
      never seen before, which you do not see now, which you have no desire to 
      see in future, -- have you any partiality, any passion, any affection for 
      such shapes?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Not so, my lord.&quot; -- </FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Samyutta Nikaya iv. 72</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What are those shapes you have not seen 
      before? Towns and villages and countries you have never been to, men and 
      women living there, and other scenes. How can anyone fall in love with men 
      and women he or she hasn&#39;t ever seen? How can you cling to them? So, you 
      do not cling to things you have never seen. No defilements arise in 
      respect of them. You do not need to meditate on them. But things you see 
      are another matter. Defilements can arise -- that is to say, if you fail 
      to<B> </B>meditate to prevent them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The same is true of things heard, smelled, 
      tasted, touched, thought on.</FONT></P>
