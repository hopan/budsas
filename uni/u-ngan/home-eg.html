        determine in your mind to listen with respect to the <i>Dhamma</i>. 
        During the time that I am speaking, be as attentive to my words as if it 
        were the Lord Buddha himself sitting in front of you. Close your eyes 
        and make yourself comfortable, compose your mind and make it 
        one-pointed. Humbly allow the Triple Gem of wisdom, truth and purity to 
        abide in your heart as a way of showing respect to the Fully Enlightened 
        One.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Today I have brought 
        nothing material of any substance to offer you, only <i>Dhamma</i>, the 
        teachings of the Lord Buddha. Listen well. You should understand that 
        even the Buddha himself, with his great store of accumulated virtue, 
        could not avoid physical death. When he reached old age, he relinquished 
        his body and let go of its heavy burden. Now you too must learn to be 
        satisfied with the many years you've already depended on your body. You 
        should feel that it's enough.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You can compare it to 
        household utensils that you've had for a long time -- your cups, 
        saucers, plates and so on. When you first had them they were clean and 
        shining, but now after using them for so long, they’re starting to 
        wear out. Some are already broken, some have disappeared and those that 
        are left are deteriorating; they have no stable form, and it's their 
        nature to be like that. Your body is the same way -- it's been 
        continually changing right from the day you were born, through childhood 
        and youth, until now it's reached old age. You must accept that. The 
        Buddha said that conditions <i>(sankhàras),</i> whether they are 
        internal conditions, bodily conditions, or external conditions, are 
        not-self, their nature is to change. Contemplate this truth until you 
        see it clearly.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This very lump of flesh 
        that lies here in decline is <i>saccadhamma, </i>the truth. The truth of 
        this body is <i>saccadhamma</i>, and it is the unchanging teaching of 
        the Buddha. The Buddha taught us to look at the body, to contemplate it 
        and to come to terms with its nature. We must be able to be at peace 
        with the body, whatever state it is in. The Buddha taught that we should 
        ensure that it's only the body that is locked up in jail and not let the 
        mind be imprisoned along with it. Now as your body begins to run down 
        and deteriorate with age, don't resist that, but don't let your mind 
        deteriorate with it. Keep the mind separate. Give energy to the mind by 
        realizing the truth of the way things are. The Lord Buddha taught that 
        this is the nature of the body, it can't be any other way: having been 
        born it gets old and sick and then it dies. This is a great truth that 
        you are presently encountering. Look at the body with wisdom and realize 
        it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even if your house is 
        flooded or burnt to the ground, whatever the danger that threatens it, 
        let it concern only the house. If there's a flood, don't let it flood 
        your mind. If there's a fire, don't let it burn your heart. Let it be 
        merely the house, that which is external to you, that is flooded and 
        burnt. Allow the mind to let go of its attachments. The time is ripe.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You've been alive a long 
        time. Your eyes have seen any number of forms and colours, Your ears 
        have heard so many sounds, you’ve had any number of experiences. And 
        that’s all they were -- just experiences. You’ve eaten de- licious 
        foods and all the good tastes were just good tastes, nothing more. The 
        unpleasant tastes were just unpleasant tastes, that's all. If the eye 
        sees a beautiful form that’s all it is, just a beautiful form. An ugly 
        form is just an ugly form. The ear hears an entrancing, melodious sound 
        and it's nothing more than that. A grating, disharmonious sound is 
        simply so.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that rich 
        or poor, young or old, human or animal, no being in this world can 
        maintain itself in any one state for long, everything experiences change 
        and estrangement. This is a fact of life that we can do nothing to 
        remedy. But the Buddha said that what we can do is to contemplate the 
        body and mind so as to see their impersonality, see that neither of them 
        is &quot;me&quot; or &quot;mine.&quot; They have a merely provisional 
        reality. It's like this house, it's only nominally yours, you couldn't 
        take it with you anywhere. It's the same with your wealth, your 
        possessions and your family -- they're all yours only in name, they 
        don't really belong to you, they belong to nature. Now this truth 
        doesn't apply to you alone; everyone is in the same position, even the 
        Lord Buddha and his enlightened disciples. They differed from us in only 
        one respect and that was in their acceptance of the way things are; they 
        saw that it could be no other way. So the Buddha taught us to scan and 
        examine this body from the soles of the feet up to the crown of the head 
        and then back down to the feet again. Just take a look at the body. What 
        sort of things do you see? Is there anything intrinsically clean there? 
        Can you find any abiding essence? This whole body is steadily 
        degenerating and the Buddha taught us to see that it doesn't belong to 
        us. It's natural for the body to be this way, because all conditioned 
        phenomena are subject to change. How else would you have it be? Actually 
        there's nothing wrong with the way the body is. It is not the body that 
        causes you suffering, it's your wrong thinking. When you see the right 
        wrongly, there's bound to be confusion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It's like the water of a 
        river. It naturally flows down the gradient, it never flows against it; 
        that's its nature. If a person were to go and stand on a river bank, and 
        seeing the water flowing swiftly down its course, foolishly want it to 
        flow back up the gradient, he would suffer. Whatever he was doing his 
        wrong thinking would allow him no peace of mind. He would be unhappy 
        because of his wrong view, thinking against the stream. If he had right 
        view he would see that the water must inevitably flow down the gradient, 
        and until he realized and accepted that fact the man would be agitated 
        and upset.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The river that must flow 
        down the gradient is like your body. Having been young, your body has 
        become old and now it's meandering towards its death. Don't go wishing 
        it was otherwise, it's not something you have the power to remedy. The 
        Buddha told us to see the way things are and then let go of our clinging 
        to them. Take this feeling of letting go as your refuge.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Keep meditating even if you 
        feel tired and exhausted. Let your mind dwell with the breath. Take a 
        few deep breaths, then establish the mind on the breath using the mantra 
        &quot;<b><i>Buddho</i></b>.&quot; Make this practice habitual. The more 
        exhausted you feel, the more subtle and focused your concentration must 
        be, so that you can cope with the painful sensations that arise. When 
        you start to feel fatigued then bring all your thinking to a halt, let 
        the mind gather itself together and then turn to knowing the breath. 
        Just keep up the inner recitation &quot;<i>Bud-dho, Bud-dho</i>.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let go of all externals. 
        Don't go grasping at thoughts of your children and relatives, don't 
        grasp at anything whatsoever. Let go. Let the mind unite in a single 
        point and let that composed mind dwell with the breath. Let the breath 
        be its sole object of knowledge. Concentrate until the mind becomes 
        increasingly subtle, until feelings are insignificant and there is great 
        inner clarity and wakefulness. Then when painful sensations arise they 
        will gradually cease of their own accord. Finally you’ll look on the 
        breath as if it was a relative come to visit you.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When a relative leaves we 
        follow him out and see him off. We watch until he's walked or driven out 
        of sight and then we go back indoors. We watch the breath in the same 
        way. If the breath is coarse we know that it’s coarse, if it's subtle 
        we know that it’s subtle. As it becomes increasingly fine we keep 
        following it while simultaneously awakening the mind. Eventually the 
        breath disappears altogether and all that remains is the feeling of 
        wakefulness This is called meeting the Buddha. We have that clear 
        wakeful awareness that is called &quot;<i>Buddho</i>,&quot; the one who 
        knows, the one who is awake, the radiant one. It is meeting and dwelling 
        with the Buddha, with knowledge and clarity. For it was only the 
        historical flesh-and-blood Buddha that entered parinibbàna; the true 
        Buddha, the Buddha that is clear radiant knowing, we can still 
        experience and attain today, and when we do so the heart is one.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So let go, put everything 
        down, everything except the knowing. Don't be fooled if visions or 
        sounds arise in your mind during meditation. Put them all down. Don't 
        take hold of anything at all. Just stay with this non-dual awareness. 
        Don't worry about the past or the future, just be still and you will 
        reach the place where there's no advancing, no retreating and no 
        stopping, where there's nothing to grasp at or cling to. Why? Because 
        there's no self, no &quot;me'' or &quot;mine.&quot; It's all gone. The 
        Buddha taught us to be emptied of everything in this way, not to carry 
        anything with us. To know, and having known, let go.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Realizing the Dhamma, the 
        path to freedom from the round of birth and death, is a job that we all 
        have to do alone. So keep trying to let go and to understand the 
        teachings. Really put effort into your contemplation. Don’t worry 
        about your family. At the moment they are as they are, in the future 
        they will be like you. There‘s no one in the world who can escape this 
        fate. The Buddha told us to put down everything that lacks a real 
        abiding substance. If you put everything down you will see the truth, if 
        you don't you won’t. That's the way it is and it's the same for all, 
        so don’t worry or grasp at anything.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even if you find yourself 
        thinking, well that’s all right too, as long as you think wisely. 
        Don't think foolishly. If you think of your children think of them with 
        wisdom, not with foolishness. Whatever the mind turns to, then think and 
        know that thing with wisdom, aware of its nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If you know something with 
        wisdom then you let it go and there's no suffering. The mind is bright, 
        joyful and at peace, and turning away from distractions it is undivided. 
        Right now what you can look to for help and support is your breath.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is your own work, 
        nobody else's. Leave others to do their own work. You have your own duty 
        and responsibility and you don't have to take on those of your family. 
        Don't take anything else on, let it all go. That letting go will make 
        your mind calm. Your sole responsibility right now is to focus your mind 
        and bring it to peace. Leave everything else to others. Forms, sounds, 
        odours, tastes -- leave them to others to attend to. Put everything 
        behind you and do your own work, fulfill your own responsibility. 
        Whatever arises in your mind, be it fear of pain, fear of death, anxiety 
        about others or whatever, say to it: &quot;Don't disturb me. You’re 
        not my business any more.&quot; Just keep saying this to yourself when 
        you see those <i>dhammas</i> arise.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What does the word <i>&quot;dhamma&quot;</i> 
        refer to? Everything is a <i>dhamma.</i> There is nothing that is not<i> 
        dhamma</i>. And what about &quot;worlds&quot;? The world is the very 
        mental state that is agitating you at this moment. &quot;What will this 
        person do? What will that person do? When I'm dead who will look after 
        them? How will they manage? &quot;This is all just &quot;the 
        world.&quot; Even the mere arising of a thought fearing death or pain is 
        the world. Throw the world away! The world is the way it is. If you 
        allow it to arise in the mind and dominate consciousness, then the mind 
        becomes obscured and can't see itself. So whatever appears in the mind 
        just say: &quot;This isn’t my business. It's impermanent, 
        unsatisfactory and not-self.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking you’d like to go 
        on living for a long time will make you suffer. But thinking you'd like 
        to die right away or die very quickly<i> </i>isn't right either; it's 
        suffering, isn't it? Conditions don't belong to us, they follow their 
        own natural laws. You can't do anything about the way the body</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">is. You can prettify it a 
        little, make it look attractive and clean for a while, like the young 
        girls who paint their lips and let their nails grow long, but when old 
        age arrives, everyone’s in the same boat. That's the way the body is, 
        you can't make it any other way. But what you can improve and beautify 
        is the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Anyone can build a house of 
        wood and bricks, but the Buddha taught that that sort of home is not our 
        real home, it's only nominally ours, it's a home in the world and it 
        follows the ways of the world. <b><i>Our real home is inner peace</i></b>. 
        An external material home may well be pretty but it is not very 
        peaceful. There's this worry and then that, this anxiety and then that. 
        So we say it's not our real home; it's external to us, sooner or later 
        we'll have to give it up. It's not a place we can live in permanently 
        because it doesn't truly belong to us, it's part of the world. Our body 
        is the same; we take it to be self, to be &quot;me&quot; and 
        &quot;mine,&quot; but in fact it's not really so at all, it's another 
        worldly home. Your body has followed its natural course from birth until 
        now it's old and sick and you can't forbid it from doing that, that's 
        the way it is. Wanting it to be different would be as foolish as wanting 
        a duck to be like a chicken. When you see that that's impossible, that a 
        duck has to be a duck, that a chicken has to be a chicken and that 
        bodies have to get old and die, you will find strength and energy. 
        However much you want the body to go on and last for a long time, it 
        won't do that.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said:</font></p>
        <i>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Aniccà vata sankhàra<br>
          Uppàdavayadhammino<br>
          Uppajjitvà nìrujjhanti<br>
          Tesam vùpasamo sukho.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Conditions are 
        impermanent,<br>
        subject<b> </b>to rise and fall.<br>
        Having arisen they cease --<br>
        their stilling is bliss.&quot;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The word <i>&quot;sankhàra&quot;</i> 
        refers to this body and mind. <i>Sankhàras</i> are impermanent and 
        unstable, having come into being they disappear having arisen they pass 
        away and yet everyone wants them to, be permanent. This is foolishness. 
        Look at the breath. Having come in it goes out; that's its natures, 
        that's how it has to be. The inhalation and exhalation have to 
        alternate, there must be change. <i>Sankhàras </i>exist through change. 
        You can’t prevent it. Just think: could you exhale without inhaling? 
        Would it feel good? Or could you just inhale? We want things to be 
        permanent but they can't be, it’s impossible<b>. </b>Once the breath 
        has come in<b>, </b>it must go out, when it's gone out it comes in 
        again, and that’s natural, isn't it? Having been born we get old and 
        sick and then we die, and that’s totally natural and normal. It's 
        because <i>sankhàras</i> have done their job, because the in-breaths 
        and out breaths have alternated in this way that the human race is still 
        here today.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as we're born we're 
        dead. Our birth and our death are just one thing. It’s<b> </b>like a 
        tree: when there's a root there must be twigs. When there are twigs 
        there must be a root. You can't have one without the other. It's a 
        little funny to see how at a death people are so grief-stricken and 
        distracted, tearful and sad, and at a birth how happy and delighted. 
        It's delusion, nobody has ever looked at this clearly. I think if you 
        really want to cry then it would be better to do so when someone's born. 
        For actually birth is death, death is birth, the root is the twig, the 
        twig is the root. If you've got to cry, cry at the root, cry at the 
        birth. Look closely: if there was no birth there would be no death. Can 
        you understand this?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Don't think a lot. Just 
        think &quot;this is the way things are.&quot; It’s your work, your 
        duty. Right now nobody can help you, there's nothing that your family 
        and your possessions can do for you. All that can help you now is the 
        correct awareness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So don't waver. Let go. 
        Throw it all away.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even if you don't let go, 
        everything is starting to leave anyway. Can you see that, how all the 
        different parts of your body are trying to slip away? Take your hair: 
        when you were young it was thick and black, now it's falling out. It's 
        leaving. Your eyes used to be good and strong and now they're weak and 
        your sight is unclear. When the organs have had enough they leave, this 
        isn't their home. When you were a child your teeth were healthy and 
        firm, now they're wobbly, perhaps you've got false ones. Your eyes, 
        ears, nose, tongue -- everything is trying to leave because this isn't 
        their home. You can't make a permanent home in a <i>sankhàra</i>, you 
        can stay for a short while and then you have to go. It’s like a tenant 
        watching over his tiny little house with failing eyes. His teeth aren’t 
        so good, his ears aren't so good, his body’s not so healthy, 
        everything is leaving.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So you needn't worry about 
        any thing because this isn’t your real home, it's just a temporary 
        shelter. Having come into this world you should contemplate its nature. 
        Everything there is, is preparing to disappear. Look at your body. Is 
        there anything there that's still in its. your original form? Is your 
        skin as it used to be? Is your hair? It's not the same, is it? Where has 
        everything gone? This is nature, the way things are. When their time is 
        up, conditions go their way. This world is nothing to rely on -- it's an 
        endless round of disturbance and troubles, pleasures and pains. There’s 
        no peace.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we have no real home 
        we’re like an aimless traveler out on the road, going this way for a 
        while and then that ways stopping for a while and then setting off 
        again. Until we return to our real home we feel ill-at-ease whatever we’re 
        doing, just like one who’s left his village to go on a journey. Only 
        when he gets home again can he really relax and be at ease.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nowhere in the world is any 
        real peace to be found. The poor have no peace and neither do the rich. 
        Adults have no peace, children have no peace, the poorly educated have 
        no peace and neither do the highly-educated. There's no peace anywhere. 
        That's the nature of the world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have few 
        possessions suffer and so do those who have many. Children, adults, the 
        aged, everyone suffers. The suffering of being old, the suffering of 
        being young, the suffering of being wealthy and the suffering of being 
        poor -- it's all nothing but suffering.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When you've contemplated 
        things in this way you'll see <i>anicca</i>, impermanence, and <i>dukkha</i>, 
        unsatisfactoriness. Why are things impermanent and unsatisfactory? It’s 
        because they're <i>anattà</i>, not-self.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Both your body that is 
        lying here sick and painful, and the mind that is aware of its sickness 
        and pain, are called <i>dhammas</i>. That which is formless, the 
        thoughts, feelings and perceptions, is called <i>nàmadhamma</i>. That 
        which is racked with aches and pains is called <i>rùpadhamma</i>. The 
        material is <i>dhamma</i> and the immaterial is <i>dhamma</i>. So we 
        live with <i>dhammas</i>, in <i>dhammas</i>, we are <i>dhammas</i>. In 
        truth there's no self anywhere to be found, there are only <i>dhammas</i> 
        continually arising and passing away, as is their nature. Every single 
        moment we're undergoing birth and death. This is the way things are.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we think of the Lord 
        Buddha, how truly he spoke, we feel how worthy he is of salutation, 
        reverence and respect. Whenever we see the truth of something we see his 
        teachings, even if we've never actually practised <i>Dhamma</i>. But 
        even if we have a knowledge of the teachings, have studied and practised 
        them, but still haven't seen their truth, then we're still homeless.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So understand this point 
        that all people, all creatures, are about to leave. When beings have 
        lived an appropriate time they go their way. The rich, the poor, the 
        young, the old, all beings must experience this change.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When you realize that 
        that's the way the world is, you'll feel that it's a wearisome place. 
        When you see that there's nothing stable or substantial you can rely on, 
        you'll feel wearied and disenchanted. Being disenchanted doesn't mean 
        you're averse though. The mind is clear. It sees that there's nothing to 
        be done to remedy this state of affairs, it's just the way the world is. 
        Knowing in this way, you can let go of attachment, let go with a mind 
        that is neither happy nor sad, but at peace with <i>sankhàras</i> 
        through seeing with wisdom their changing nature.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Aniccà vata sankhàra</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        -- all <i>sankhàras</i> are impermanent. To put it simply: impermanence 
        is the Buddha. If we see an impermanent phenomena really clearly, we'll 
        see that it's permanent, permanent in the sense that it’s subjection 
        to change is unchanging. This is<b> </b>the permanence that living 
        beings possess. There is continual transformation, from childhood 
        through youth to old age, and that very imper-manence, that nature to 
        change, is permanent and fixed. If you look at it like that your heart 
        will be at ease. It's not just you that has to go through this, it's 
        everyone.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When you consider things 
        thus you'll see them as wearisome, and disenchantment will arise. Your 
        delight in the world of sense pleasures will disappear. You'll see that 
        if you<b> </b>have a lot of things, you have to leave a lot behind; if 
        you have few, you leave behind few. Wealth <b>is </b>just wealth, long 
        life is just long life, they're nothing special.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What's important is that we 
        should do as the Lord Buddha taught and build our own home, building it 
        by the method that I've been explaining to you. Build your home. Let go. 
        Let go until the mind reaches the peace that is free from advancing, 
        free from retreating and free from stopping still. Pleasure is not our 
        home, pain is not our home. Pleasure and pain both decline and pass<b> </b>away.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Great Teacher saw that 
        all are impermanent and so<b> </b>he taught us to let go of our 
        attachment to them. When we reach<b> </b>the end of<i> </i>our life, we’ll 
        have no choice anyway, we won't be able to take anything with us. So 
        wouldn't it be better to put things down before that? They're just a 
        heavy burden to carry around; why not throw off that load now? Why 
        bother to drag them around? Let go, relax, and let your family look 
        after you.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who nurse the sick 
        grow in goodness and virtue. 0ne who is sick and giving others that 
        opportunity shouldn't make things difficult for them. If there's a pain 
        or some problem or other let them know and keep the mind in a wholesome 
        state. One who is nursing parents should fill his or her mind with 
        warmth and kindness, not get caught in aversion. This is the one time 
        when you can repay the debt you owe them. From your birth through your 
        childhood, as you've grown up, you’ve been dependent on your parents. 
        That we are here today is because our mothers and father have helped us 
        in so many<i> </i>ways. We owe them an incredible debt of gratitude. So 
        today, all of you children and relatives gathered here together, see how 
        your parents become your children. Before you were their children, now 
        they becomes yours. They become older and older until they become 
        children again. Their memories go, their eyes don't see so well and 
        their ears don't hear, sometimes they garble their words. Don't let it 
        upset you. All of you nursing the sick must know how to let go. Don't 
        hold onto things, just let go and let them have their own way. When a 
        young child is disobedient sometimes the parents let it have its own way 
        just to keep the peace, to make it happy. Now your parents are like that 
        child. Their memories and perceptions are confused. Sometimes they 
        muddle up your names or you ask them to give you a cup and they bring a 
        plate. It's normal, don't be upset by it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let the patient remember 
        the kindness of those who nurse and patiently endure the painful 
        feelings. Exert yourself mentally, don't let the mind become scattered 
        and agitated, and don't make things difficult for those looking after 
        you. Let those who nurse the sick fill their minds with virtue and 
        kindness. Don't be averse to the unattractive side of the job, to 
        cleaning up mucus and phlegm, or urine and excrement. Try your best. 
        Everyone in the family give a hand.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are the only parents 
        you've got. They gave you life, they have been your teachers, your 
        nurses and your doctors – they’ve been everything to you. That they 
        have brought you up, taught you, shared their wealth with you and made 
        you their heirs is the great beneficence of parents. Consequently the 
        Buddha taught the virtues of <i>katannu</i> and <i>katavedi</i>, of 
        knowing our debt of gratitude and of trying to repay it. These two 
        virtues are complementary. If our parents are in need, if they're unwell 
        or in difficulty, then we do our best to help them. This is <i>katannu-katavedi;</i> 
        it is a virtue that sustains the world. It prevents families from 
        breaking up, it makes them stable and harmonious.</font></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman">* * *</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Today I have brought you 
        the <i>Dhamma</i> as a gift in this time of illness. I have no material 
        things to give you; there seem to be plenty of those in the house 
        already, and so I give you <i>Dhamma</i>, something which has a lasting 
        worth, something which you'll never be able to exhaust. Having received 
        it from me you can pass it on to as many others as you like and it will 
        never be depleted. That is the nature of Truth. I am happy to have been 
        able to give you this gift of <i>Dhamma</i> and hope it will give you 
        strength to deal with your pain.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">AJAHN CHAH</font></p>
        </b><font size="6">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A</font></font><font face="Times New Roman">jahn 
        Chah was born into a large and comfortable family in a rural village in 
        Northeast Thailand. He ordained as a novice in early youth and on 
        reaching the age of twenty took higher ordination as a monk. As a young 
        monk he studied some basic Dhamma, Discipline and scriptures. Later he 
        practised meditation under the guidance of several of the local 
        meditation masters in the ascetic forest tradition. He wandered for a 
        number of years in the style of an ascetic monk, sleeping in forests, 
        caves and cremation grounds, and spent a short but enlightening period 
        with Ajahn Mun, one of the most famous and respected Thai meditation 
        masters of this century.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After many years of travel 
        and practice, he was invited to settle in a thick forest grove near the 
        village of his birth. This grove was uninhabited, known as a place of 
        cobras, tigers and ghosts, thus being, as he said, the perfect location 
        for a forest monk. Around Ajahn Chah a large monastery formed as more 
        and more monks, nuns and lay people came to hear his teachings and stay 
        on to practise with him. Now there are more than forty mountain and 
        forest branch temples throughout Thailand and in England and Australia 
        as well.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On entering Wat Pah Pong 
        one is likely to encounter monks drawing water from a well, and a sign 
        on the path that says: &quot;You there, be quiet! We're trying to 
        meditate.&quot; Although there is a group meditation twice a day, the 
        heart of the meditation is the way of life. Monks do manual work, dye 
        and sew their own robes, make most of their own requisites and keep the 
        monastery buildings and grounds in immaculate shape. Monks here live 
        extremely simply following the ascetic precepts of eating once a day 
        from the almsbowl and limiting their possessions and robes. Scattered 
        throughout the forest are individual huts where monks live and meditate 
        in solitude, and where they practise walking meditation on cleared paths 
        under the trees.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Discipline is extremely 
        strict enabling one to lead a simple and pure life in a harmoniously 
        regulated community where virtue, meditation and understanding may be 
        skillfully and continuously cultivated.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Chah's simple yet 
        profound style of teaching has a special appeal to Westerners, and many 
        have come to study and practise with him, quite a few for many years. In 
        1975 Wat Pah Nanachat was established near Wat Pah Pong as a special 
        training monastery for the growing number of Westerners interested in 
        undertaking monastic training. Since then Ajahn Chah's large following 
        of senior Western disciples has begun the work of spreading the Dhamma 
        in the West. Ajahn Chah has himself travelled twice to Europe and North 
        America, and he has established a thriving branch monastery in Sussex, 
        England.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom is a way of living 
        and being, and Ajahn Chah has endeavoured to preserve the simple 
        lifestyle of the monks in order that people may study and practise 
        Dhamma in the present day.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Chah's wonderfully 
        simple style of teaching can be deceptive. It is often only after one 
        has heard something from him many times that suddenly one's mind is ripe 
        and somehow the teaching takes on a much deeper meaning. His skillful 
        means in tailoring his explanations of Dhamma to time and place, and to 
        the understanding and sensitivity of his audience, is marvellous to see. 
        Sometimes on paper, though, it can make him seem inconsistent or even 
        self-contradictory! At such times the reader should remember that these 
        words are a record of living experience. Similarly, if the teaching may 
        seem to vary at times from tradition, it should be borne in mind that 
        the venerable Ajahn speaks always from the heart, from the depths of his 
        own meditative experience.</font></p>
