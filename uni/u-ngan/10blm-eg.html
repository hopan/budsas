        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>here 
        are ten transcendental virtues, which, in<b> </b>Pàli, are termed <i>Pàramì 
        </i>[1]<i> </i>that every Bodhisatta practises in order to gain Supreme 
        Enlightenment -- Sammà-Sambuddhahood. They are Generosity <i>(Dàna), </i>Moralitv 
        <i>(Sìla),</i> Renunciation <i>(Nekkhamma), </i>Wisdom <i>(Pannà),</i><b> 
        </b>Energy<i> (Viriya) </i>Patience <i>(Khanti), </i>Truthfulness <i>(Sacca), 
        </i>Determination <i>(Adhitthàna) </i>and Equanimity </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(Upekkhà).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Cariyà 
        PiTaka Commentary, <i>Pàramì </i>are those virtues which are 
        cultivated with compassion, guided by reason, uninfluenced by selfish 
        motives. and unsullied by misbelief and all feelings of self-conceit.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The actions of a Bodhisatta 
        are absolutely selfless, being prompted solely by compassion towards all 
        beings. so boundless is his love and so pervasive is his infinite 
        compassion that unceasingly throughout the series of his countless lives 
        he strives to diminish suffering, to elevate to greater honour the poor 
        and the lowly, and to help the needy in every possible way.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He seeks no delight in 
        self-indulgence while his less fortunate brethren and sisters are 
        steeped in misery. To alleviate suffering he would not hesitate to 
        sacrifice his most cherished possessions -- not excepting life itself as 
        illustrated in the story in the Vyàghri-Jàtaka</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With heart full of 
        compassion he works for the weal and happiness of all beings; though 
        always guided by reason. He is generously endowed with all the essential 
        qualities of both head and heart in their full development which are 
        dedicated to the service of the world at large.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In serving others a 
        Bodhisatta is not actuated by a desire for power or worldly possessions. 
        Knowing as he does that fame comes unsought to him who is worthy of it, 
        why should he pursue it?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He is completely altruistic 
        in his motives and egoism plays no part in his disinterested activities.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Let laymen and monks 
        both think that this was done by myself. In every work great or small, 
        let them refer to me. Such is the aspiration of the fool. His desires 
        and pride increase,&quot; states the Dhammapada (v.74). Such narrow and 
        selfish aspirations do not enter into the mind of a Bodhisatta.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">1. DÀNA</font></p>
        </b><i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dàna</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        or Generosity is the first Pàrami. It confers upon the giver the double 
        blessing of inhibiting immoral thoughts of selfishness, while developing 
        pure thoughts of selflessness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It blesseth him that 
        gives and him that takes.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bodhisatta is not 
        concerned as to whether the recipient is truly in need or not, for his 
        one object in practising generosity, as he does, is to eliminate craving 
        that lies dormant within himself. The joy of service, its attendant 
        happiness, and the alleviation of suffering are other blessings of 
        generosity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In extending his love with 
        supernormal generosity, he makes no distinction between one being and 
        another, but he uses judicious discrimination in this generosity. If, 
        for instance, a drunkard were to seek his help, and, if he were 
        convinced that the drunkard would misuse his gift, the Bodhisatta 
        without hesitation would refuse it, for such misplaced generosity would 
        not constitute a Pàramì.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Should anyone seek his help 
        for a worthy purpose, then instead of assuming a forced air of dignity 
        or making false pretensions, he would simply express his deep obligation 
        for the opportunity afforded, and willingly and humbly render every 
        possible aid. Yet, he would never set it down to his own credit as a 
        favour conferred upon another, nor would he ever regard the man as his 
        debtor for the service rendered. He is interested only in the good act, 
        but in nothing else springing from it. He expects no reward in return, 
        nor even does he crave enhancement of reputation from it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bodhisatta, though always 
        ready to confer a favour, seldom, if ever, stoops to ask one. The Brahma 
        Jàtaka (No. 323) relates that once the Bodhisatta was leading an 
        ascetic life in the park of a certain king who used to visit him daily 
        and minister to his needs. Yet, for twelve long years he refrained from 
        asking the boon of a pair of sandals and a leaf-parasol, trifling as 
        they were.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When questioned as to his 
        strange, but modest attitude, he replied to the king:-</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Who beg, <i>Pancàla, 
        </i>Lord, to weep are fain.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They who refuse are apt to 
        weep again&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In abundance he gives to 
        others, irrespective of caste, creed, or colour, though seeking nothing 
        for himself in return. A characteristic of his mind is perfect 
        contentment such as the poet Edward Dyer contemplated.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Some have too much, 
        yet still do crave,</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        <i>I little have and seek no more,<br>
        They are but poor though much they have,</i><br>
        </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">And I am rich with little 
        store.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Kanha Jàtaka (No. 
        440) it is related that <i>Sakka, </i>attracted by the exemplary, 
        virtuous life of the Bodhisatta, approached him and offered him a boon. 
        Acceding to Sakka's kindly request, he wished for the following:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. May I harbour no malice 
        or hatred against my neighbour!<br>
        2. May I not covet my neighbour's possessions!<br>
        3. May I cherish no personal affection towards others!<br>
        4. May I possess</font><i><font face="Times New Roman"> equanimity!</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Greatly disappointed, 
        though full of admiration for the disinterest shown, Sakka entreated him 
        to choose yet another boon.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He replied:--</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Where in the wood I 
        ever dwell,</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        <i>Where all alone dwell I,<br>
        Grant no disease may mar any peace,</i><br>
        </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Or break my ecstasy.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hearing this, <i>Sakka </i>thought-&quot;Wise<i> 
        Kanha, </i>in choosing a boon, chooses nothing connected with food. All 
        he chooses pertain to the ascetic life!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Yet again <i>Sakka </i>said, 
        &quot;Choose a boon!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisatta responded:</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O Sakka, Lord of the 
        world, a</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"><b> </b><i>choice thou 
        doest declare:<br>
        No creature be aught harmed for me</i><b> </b><i>O</i><b> </b><i>Sakka,</i> 
        <i>anywhere,<br>
        Neither in</i> <i>body nor in mind, this, Sakka, is my</i> <i>prayer.&quot; 
        (</i>Jàtaka Stories, No. 440.)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bodhisatta<b> </b>exercises 
        this virtue of generosity to such an extent that he is prepared to give 
        away not only wealth and other cherished possessions, but also his 
        kingdom, his limbs and even his children and wife; and he is ever ready 
        to sacrifice his own life wherever such sacrifice would benefit 
        humanity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Vessantara Jàtaka</i> 
        (No. 547) relates how, when Prince <i>Vessantara </i>was a child of only 
        eight years, he thought with all sincerity: &quot;If one should need my 
        heart, I would cut open my breast, tear it out and give it; if one 
        should need my eyes, I would gouge them out and give them; if one should 
        need my flesh, I would cut off what he needed.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Vyàghrì Jàtaka 
        depicts, in growing terms, an incident in which he willingly and 
        joyfully sacrificed his life for the good and happiness of others. In 
        the <i>Jàtakamàlà</i>, the story runs as follows:--</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;On one occasion when 
        the Bodhisatta was passing through a forest, accompanied by his 
        disciple, he saw a tigress and her three cubs near death from 
        starvation. Moved to compassion, he asked his disciple to secure some 
        food for them. This was but a pretext to send him away, for the 
        Bodhisatta thought:-</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why<b> </b>should I 
        search after meat from the body of another while the whole of my own 
        body is available? Finding other meat is a matter of chance, and I may 
        well lose the opportunity of doing my duty. This body being foul and a 
        source of suffering, he is not wise who would not rejoice at its being 
        spent for the</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">benefit 
        of another. There are but two things that make one disregard the grief 
        of another -- attachment to one's own pleasure and the absence of the 
        power of helping. But I cannot take my pleasure while another grieves, 
        as long as I am able to help him. Why should I, therefore, be 
        indifferent?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;By casting myself 
        down this precipice, I sacrifice my miserable body which will feed the 
        tigress, thus preventing her from killing the young ones and saving the 
        young ones from dying by the teeth of their mother.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, by so 
        doing I set an example to those whose longings are for the good of the 
        world. I encourage the feeble; I gladden those who understand the 
        meaning of charity; and I inspire the virtuous. And finally that 
        opportunity I yearned for, when may I have the opportunity of benefiting 
        others by offering them my own limbs, I shall obtain it now, and acquire 
        before long the Sammà Sambuddhahood -- Supreme Enlightenment.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking thus, he cast 
        himself down the precipice sacrificing his life for the welfare of those 
        helpless beings.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Nevari (Nepàla 
        Bhàshà) version of this interesting and pitiful story is as follows:--</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the remote past there 
        lived a devout and powerful king named Mahàrattha. He had three sons by 
        name, Mahà Prashàda, Mahà Deva, and Mahàsattva, all good and 
        obedient.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One bright day the king, 
        accompanied by the princes and attendants, went on an excursion to a 
        forest park. The</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">young 
        princes, admiring the enchanting beauty of the flowers and trees, 
        gradually penetrated far into the thick forest.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The attendants noticed 
        their absence and reported the matter to the king. He ordered his 
        ministers to go in search of them and returned to his palace.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The three princes, 
        wandering through the forest, reached a mountain top. From there the 
        eldest saw a starving tigress with five cubs almost on the verge of 
        death. For seven days since her delivery she had been without food. The 
        cubs approached the mother to suck milk, but she had nothing to satisfy 
        their hunger, and the tigress, driven by starvation, was clearly at the 
        point of unnaturally devouring her own cubs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The eldest brother was the 
        first to see this pathetic spectacle. He showed the tigress to his 
        brothers and said:--&quot;Behold that pitiful sight, O brothers! That 
        starving tigress is about to devour her cubs. How wretched is their 
        condition!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What is their staple 
        food, brother?&quot; inquired Mahàsattva.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Flesh and blood is 
        the staple food of tigers and lions.&quot; replied Mahà Prashàda.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The tigress seems to 
        be very weak. Evidently she is without food for some days. How noble if 
        one could sacrifice one's body for their sake!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But, who is willing 
        to make such great sacrifice!&quot; remarked Mahà Deva.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Surely, no one would 
        be able to do so,&quot; stated Mahà Prashàda.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I lack intelligence. 
        Ignorant persons like us would not be able to sacrifice their bodies for 
        the sake of another. But there may be selfless men of boundless 
        compassion who would willingly do so,&quot; said Mahàsattva in a 
        merciful tone.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus they discussed amongst 
        themselves and casting a last glance at the helpless tigress, they 
        departed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mahàsattva thought to 
        himself:--</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sacrifice I must this 
        fleeting body for the sake of this starving tigress. Foul is this body, 
        and is subject to decay and death. One may adorn and perfume it, but<b> </b>soon 
        it will stink and perish.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reflecting thus, he 
        requested his brothers to proceed as he would be retiring to the forest 
        for some reason or other.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He retraced his steps to 
        the place where the tigress was resting. Hanging his garments and 
        ornaments on a tree, again he thought:--</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Work I must for the 
        weal of others. Compassionate we must be towards all beings. To serve 
        those who need our succour is our paramount duty. This foul body of mine 
        will I sacrifice and thus save the tigress and her five cubs. By this 
        meritorious act may I gain Sammà Sambuddhahood and save all beings from 
        the ocean of Samsàra! May all beings be well and happy!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Moved by compassion and 
        inspired by the spirit of selfless service, dauntlessly he jumped off 
        the precipice towards the tigress.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The fall did not result in 
        an instantaneous death. The tigress, though ruthless by nature, pitied 
        the Bodhisattva and would not even touch his body.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisattva thought 
        otherwise: &quot;Obviously the poor animal is too weak to devour 
        me!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So h<b>c </b>went in search 
        of a weapon. He came across a bamboo splinter, and drawing near the 
        tigress, he cut off his neck and fell dead on the ground in a pool of 
        blood.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The hungry tigress greedily 
        drank the blood and devoured the flesh leaving mere bones.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The story adds that, at the 
        moment the Bodhisattva sacrificed his body, the earth quaked, the waters 
        of the ocean were disturbed, the sun's rays dimmed, eye-sight was 
        temporarily blurred, Devas gave cries of Sàdhu, and Pàrijàta flowers 
        came down as rain from heaven.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Affected by the earthquake, 
        the two elder brothers rightly guessed that their younger brother must 
        have become a prey to the tigress.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Surely, Mahàsattva 
        must have sacrificed his life, for he spoke in a very merciful 
        tone,&quot; said Mahà Deva.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Both of them turned back 
        and went to the spot. They were horrified and awe-struck at the 
        unexpected spectacle. What they saw was not their beloved brother but a 
        mass of bones besmeared with blood. On a tree close by they saw the 
        hanging garments.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They wept and<b> </b>fainted 
        and on regaining consciousness, they returned home with a heavy heart.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the very<b> </b>day the 
        Bodhisattva sacrificed his life the mother-queen dreamt that she was 
        dead, that her teeth had</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">fallen 
        out, and that she experienced a pain as if her body were cut by a sharp 
        weapon. Furthermore, she dreamt that a hawk came drooping down and 
        carried one of the three beautiful pigeons that were perched on the 
        roof.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The queen was frightened, 
        and on waking she remembered that her princes had gone for an airing in 
        the forest. She hastened to the king and related the inauspicious 
        dreams.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On being informed that the 
        princes were missing, she entreated the king to send messengers in 
        search of them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some ministers who had gone 
        earlier to search for them</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">returned 
        to the palace with the sad news of the lamentable death of the youngest

        however, comforted the queen and, mounting an elephant, speedily 
        proceeded to the forest with his attendants and<b> </b>brought back the 
        other two grieving sons.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So great was their grief 
        that at first they were speechless. Later summoning up courage, they 
        explained to their bereaved mother the heroic deed of their noble 
        brother.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Soon the order was given by

        course. At the mere sight of the blood-smeared bones of the dearest son 
        scattered here and there, both the king and queen fainted. The Purohita 
        Brahmin instantly poured sandal wood water over them, and they regained 
        consciousness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thereupon the king ordered 
        his ministers to gather all the hair, bones, and garments and, heaping 
        them together, worshipped them. Advising them to erect a golden Cetiya 
        enshrining the relics, with a grieving heart, he departed to his palace.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Cetiya was afterwards

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As in the other Jàtakas

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In giving food the 
        Bodhisatta intends thereby to endow the recipient with long life, 
        beauty, happiness, strength, wisdom, and the Highest Fruit, Nibbàna. He 
        gives thirsty beings to drink with the object of quenching the thirst of 
        passion; garments to acquire moral shame and moral dread; conveyances to 
        cultivate psychic powers; odours for the scent of <i>Sìla</i> 
        (Morality); garlands and unguents to gain the glory pertaining to the 
        Buddha's virtues, seats to win the seat of Enlightenment; lodging with 
        the hope of serving as a refuge to the world; lights to obtain the five 
        kinds of eyes -- namely, the physical eye, the eye of wisdom, the Divine 
        Eye, the Buddha Eye, and the Eye of Omniscience; forms to possess the 
        Buddha aura; sounds to cultivate a voice as sweet as Brahma's; tastes so 
        that he may be pleasing to all; contacts to gain the delicate organism 
        of a Buddha; medicine for the sake of deathlessness (Nibbàna). He 
        emancipates slaves in order to deliver men from the thraldom of 
        passions; renounces children to develop the paternal feeling towards 
        all; renounces wives to become the master of the world; renounces 
        kingdoms to inherit the kingdom of righteousness. Besides revealing the 
        altruistic attitude of a Bodhisatta, these lofty aspirations disclose 
        his disinterested efforts for the amelioration of mankind.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bodhisatta who fulfils 
        all these household duties <i>(Càritta Sìla) </i>becomes truly a 
        refined gentleman in the strictest sense of the term. Apart from these 
        obligatory duties he endeavours his best to observe the other rules 
        relating to <i>Vàritta Sìla</i> (morality) and thus lead an ideal 
        Buddhist life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Rightly discerning the law 
        of action and reaction, of his own accord, he refrains from evil and 
        does good to the best of his ability. He considers it his duty to be a 
        blessing to himself and others, and not a curse to any, whether man or 
        animal.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As life is precious to all 
        and as no man has the right to take away the life of another, he extends 
        his compassion and loving-kindness towards every living being, even to 
        the tiniest creature that crawls at his feet, and refrains from killing 
        or causing injury to any living creature. It is the animal instinct in 
        man that prompts him mercilessly to kill the weak and feast on their 
        flesh. Whether to appease one's appetite or as a pastime it is not 
        justifiable to kill or cause a helpless animal to be killed by any 
        method whether cruel or humane. And if it is wrong to kill an animal, 
        what must be said of slaying human beings, however noble the motive may 
        at first sight appear.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, a Bodhisatta 
        abstains from all forms of stealing, direct or indirect, and thus 
        develops honesty, trustworthiness and uprightness. Abstaining from 
        mis-conduct, which debases the exalted nature of man, he tries to be 
        pure and chaste in his sex life. He avoids false speech, harsh language, 
        slander, and frivolous talk and utters only words which are true, sweet, 
        peaceable and helpful. He avoids intoxicating liquors which tend to 
        mental distraction and confusion, and cultivates heedfulness and clarity 
        of vision.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bodhisatta would adhere 
        to these five principles which tend to control deeds and words, whether 
        against his own interests or not. On a proper occasion he will sacrifice 
        not only possessions and wealth but life itself for the sake of his 
        principles.[2]</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should not be understood 
        that a Bodhisatta is perfect in his dealings in the course of his 
        wanderings in Samsàra. Being a worldling, he possesses his own failings 
        and limitations. Certain Jàtakas like the Kanavera Jàtaka (No. 318) 
        depict him as a very desperate highway robber. This, however, is the 
        exception rather than the rule.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The great importance 
        attached by an aspirant to Buddhahood to morality is evident from the 
        Sìlavimamsa Jàtaka (No. 362) where the Bodhisatta says: &quot;Apart 
        from virtue wisdom has no worth. &quot; (</font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Silena

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Still keener is the 
        enthusiasm a Bodhisatta exhibits towards <i>Nekkhamma</i> 
        (Renunciation), for by nature he is a lover of solitude<i>. Nekkhamma</i> 
        implies both renunciation of worldly pleasures by adopting the ascetic 
        life and the temporary inhibition of Hindrances<i> (Nivarana) </i>by 
        Jhànas (Ecstasies).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bodhisatta is neither 
        selfish nor self-possessive but is selfless in his activities. He is 
        ever ready to sacrifice his happiness for the sake of others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Though he may sit in the 
        lap of luxury, immersed in worldly pleasures, he may comprehend their 
        transitoriness and the value of renunciation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Realizing thus the vanity 
        of fleeting material pleasures, he voluntarily leaves his earthly 
        possessions, and donning the simple ascetic garb, tries to lead the Holy 
        Life in all its purity. Here he practices the higher morality to such an 
        extent that he becomes practically selfless in all his actions. No 
        inducement whether fame, wealth, honour, or worldly gain, could induce 
        him to do anything contrary to his principles.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, the first grey 
        hair, as in the case of the Makhàdeva Jàtaka (No. 9), is alone a 
        sufficient call to a Bodhisatta to abandon the uncongenial atmosphere of 
        the palace for the independent solitary life of a hermit. At times a 
        dew-drop or a withered leaf may induce him to adopt the ascetic life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As a rule, however, the 
        practice of renunciation is not observed by a Bodhisatta.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Kusa Jàtaka (No. 
        531), for instance, the Bodhisatta was subjected to much humiliation 
        owing to his unrestrained desire to win the hand of the beautiful 
        princess Pabhàvati.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Again in the Darìmukha 
        Jàtaka (No. 373) it is mentioned that a Pacceka Buddha, quondam friend 
        of the Bodhisatta, approached him and said:</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the period of a 
        Buddhaless Cycle a Bodhisatta would adopt the life of an ascetic and 
        lead the holy celibate life in solitude. If born in a Buddha Cycle, he 
        would lead the life of a Bhikkhu in a strict accordance with the rules 
        that pertain thereto. An ideal Bhikkhu who leads an exemplary life is a 
        blessing to himself and others. He teaches both by example and by 
        precept. Within he is pure, without he purifies.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He is very strenuous in 
        working for his inner spiritual development, catering at the same time 
        for the spiritual needs of those lesser brethren and sisters. He is no 
        burden to society because he gives no trouble to any. He is like the bee 
        that extracts honey from the flower without damaging it. He possesses no 
        property for he has renounced everything worldly. His needs are few, and 
        contentment is his wealth. He repents not for the past, nor is he 
        worried about the future. He lives in the present, free from all 
        responsibilities and trammels of the world. He is ready to wander 
        wherever he chooses for the good and happiness of others, without 
        clinging to any abode. Under all vicissitudes of life he maintains a 
        balanced mind, His free services are always at the disposal of others.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The rules laid down for a 
        Bhikkhu (Derived from the root <i>&quot;bhikkha,&quot; </i>to beg.

        to beg anything from another. He may accept the four requisites -- 
        robes, alms, lodging, medicine -- presented to him. If in need of any 
        requisite, he is allowed to ask it from his parents, close relatives, or 
        from professed supporters.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bhikkhu is not bound to 
        life-long vows. Of his own accord he enters the Order in order to lead 
        the Holy Life until he chooses to leave it. Once he dons the yellow

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nekkhamma </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">is 
        followed by <i>Pannà </i>(Wisdom or Knowledge). It is the right 
        understanding of the nature of the world in the light of transiency <i>(anicca), 
        </i>sorrowfulness <i>(dukkha) </i>and soullessness <i>(anattà). </i>A 
        Bodhisatta meditates on these three characteristics but not to such an 
        extent as to attain Arahantship, for to do this would be deviating from 
        his Goal.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the same time he<b> </b>does 
        not disparage worldly wisdom. He tries to acquire knowledge even from 
        his servants. Never does he show any desire to display his knowledge, 
        nor is he ashamed to plead ignorance even in public, for under no 
        circumstances does he ever prove to be a charlatan. What he knows is 
        always at the disposal of others, and that he imparts to them 
        unreservedly. He tries his best to lead others from darkness to light.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge is of three 
        kinds. The first is knowledge acquired orally <i>(sutamaya pannà). </i>In 
        the ancient days when printing was not in vogue knowledge was acquired 
        by hearing -- hence a learned man was then called <i>bahussuta </i>(= he 
        who has heard much), corresponding to English erudition. The second kind 
        of knowledge is acquired by thought<i> (cintàmaya pannà). </i>The 
        practical scientific knowledge of the West is the direct outcome of this 
        kind of knowledge. The third is a superior kind of knowledge acquired by 
        meditation and contemplation <i>(bhàvanàmaya pannà). </i>It is by 
        such meditation that one realizes intuitive truths which are beyond 
        logical reasoning. <i>Bhàvanà </i>or meditation is not a passive 
        reverie, but an energetic striving. It leads to self-elevation, 
        self-discipline, self-control, and self-illumination. It is a heart 
        tonic as well.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom is the apex of 
        Buddhism. It is the first factor in the Noble Eightfold Path <i>(sammà

        Vicaya Sambojjhanga). </i>It is one of the four means of Accomplish-ment 
        <i>(Vimansa-Iddhipàda). </i>It is one of the five Powers <i>(Pannà-bala)</i> 
        and one of the five controlling Faculties <i>(Pannà indriya). </i>It is

        not mean physical strength though this is an asset, but mental vigour or 
        strength of character, which is far superior. It is defined as the 
        persistent effort to work for the welfare of others both in thought and 
        deed. Firmly establishing himself in this virtue, the Bodhisatta 
        develops self-reliance and makes it one of his prominent 
        characteristics.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the words of Dr. Tagore 
        a Bodhisatta, relying on his own resources, would form his mind thus:--</font></p>

        until he was finally rescued.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Failures he views as steps 
        to success, opposition causes him to double his exertion, dangers 
        increase his courage. Cutting his way through difficulties, which impair 
        the enthusiasm of the feeble, surmounting obstacles, which dishearten 
        the ordinary, he looks straight towards his goal. Nor does he ever stop 
        until his goal is reached.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To Màra who advised the 
        Bodhisatta to abandon his quest, he said:-- &quot;Death in battle with 
        passions to me seems more honourable than a life of defeat.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Just as his wisdom is 
        always directed to the service of others, so also is his fund of energy. 
        Instead of confining it to the narrow course leading to the realization 
        of personal ends, he directs it into the open channel of activities that 
        tend to universal happiness. Ceaselessly and untiringly he works for 
        others, expecting no remuneration in return or reward. He is ever ready 
        to serve others to the best of his ability.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In certain respects <i>Viriya 
        </i>plays an even greater part than <i>Pannà </i>in the achievement of 
        the goal. In one who treads the Noble Eightfold Path, Right Effort<i> 
        (Sammà Vàyàma </i>or <i>Viriya) </i>suppresses the arising of evil 
        states, eradicates those which have arisen, stimulates good states, and 
        perfects those good states which have already arisen. It serves as one 
        of the seven Factors of Enlightenment <i>(Viriya Sambojjha~ga). </i>It 
        is one of the four Means of Accomplishment <i>(Viriyiddhipàda). </i>It 
        is <i>Viriya </i>that performs the function of the four modes of Right

        English equivalent for <i>Mettà </i>It may be rendered as benevolence, 
        goodwill, friendliness, or loving-kindness, and is defined as the wish 
        for the happiness of all beings without exception. It is this <i>Mettà</i> 
        that prompts a Bodhisatta to renounce personal deliverance for the sake 
        of others. He is permeated with boundless goodwill towards all beings 
        irrespective of caste, creed, colour, or sex. Since he is the embodiment 
        of universal love he fears none, nor is he feared by any. Wild beasts in 
        lonely jungles are his loving friends. His very presence amongst them 
        fosters their mutual friendliness. He ever cherishes in his heart 
        boundless goodwill towards all that lives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà, in Buddhism, should 
        be differentiated from personal affection <i>(pema) </i>or ordinary

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Mahà-Dhammapàla 
        Jàtaka (No. 385), it appears that the young Bodhisatta, extended his 
        loving-kindness, in equal measure, towards his cruel father who ordered 
        him to be tortured and killed, the wicked executioner, his loving, 
        weeping mother, and his humble self.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Loving-kindness possesses a 
        mystic power, which can easily influence beings far and near. A pure

        by panthers and buffaloes, by antelopes, stags and boars, I dwelt in the 
        forest. No creature was terrified of me, and neither was I afraid of any 
        creature. The power of loving-kindness was my support. Thus I dwelt upon 
        the mountain side.&quot;</font></p>

        loving-kindness. With mind at peace, he will live in a heaven of his own 
        creation. Even those who contact him will also experience that bliss. 
        When one habitually feels loving-kindness and demonstrates it in words 
        and deeds, water-tight compartments dissolve away. Distinctions 
        gradually disappear, and the &quot;I&quot; is absorbed in the 
        &quot;all&quot;. Nay, there will be no &quot;I&quot; at all. Finally one

        one from another. To a Bodhisatta there is no far and near, no enemy or

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The most difficult and the 
        most essential of all perfections is this equanimity, especially for a 
        layman who has to live in an ill-balanced world with fluctuating 
        fortunes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Slights and insults are the 
        common lot of humanity. So are praise and blame, loss and gain, pain and 
        happiness. Amidst all such vicissitudes of life a Bodhisatta tries to 
        stand unmoved like a firm rock, exercising perfect equanimity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In times of happiness and 
        adversity, amidst praise and blame, he is even-balanced. Like a lion 
        that does not tremble at any sound, he is not perturbed by the poisoned 
        darts of uncurbed tongues. Like the wind that does not cling to the 
        meshes of a net, he is not attached to the illusory pleasures of this 
        changing world. Like a lotus that is unsoiled by the mud from which it 
        springs, he lives unaffected by worldly temptations, ever calm, serene 
        and peaceful.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Just as the earth 
        whate'er is thrown<br>
        Upon her, whether sweet or foul,<br>
        Indifferent is to all alike,<br>
        Nor hatred shows, nor amity,<br>
        So likewise he in good or ill,<br>
        Must even-balanced ever be.&quot; (</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">Warren, 
        Buddhism in Translations)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As no waves break the 
        calm of ocean's depths, unruffled should his mind be.&quot; (See 
        Chalmers, <i>Buddha’s Teaching, </i>p.221.)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, a Bodhisatta 
        who practises <i>Upekkhà </i>metes out justice to all without being 
        influenced by desire <i>(chanda), </i>hatred<i> (dosa), </i>fear <i>(bhaya), 
        </i>and ignorance </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(moha).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It will be seen from the 
        above Perfections that Bodhisattahood is, in its entirety, a course of 
        self-sacrifice, discipline, renunciation, deep insight, energy, 
        forbearance, truthfulness, determination, boundless love, and perfect 
        mental equilibrium.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">* * *</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to these ten 
        Pàramis a Bodhisatta has to practise three modes of conduct <i>(cariyà) 
        </i>namely,<i> Buddhi Cariyà, </i>doing good with wisdom, not ignoring 
        self-development, <i>Nàtyattha Cariyà,</i> working for the betterment 
        of relatives, and <i>Lokattha Cariyà, </i>working for the amelioration 
        of the whole world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">By the second mode of 
        conduct is not meant nepotism, but work to promote the well-being of 
        one's kinsfolk without any favouritism.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus practising the ten 
        Pàramis to the highest pitch of perfection, while developing the three 
        modes of conduct, he traverses the tempest-tossed sea of Samsàra, 
        driven hither and thither by the irresistible force of Kamma, 
        manifesting himself at different times in multifarious births.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now he comes into being as 
        a mighty Sakka, or as a radiant Deva, at another time as a human being, 
        high or low, again as an animal and so on until finally he seeks birth 
        in the Tusita Heaven, having consummated the Pàramìs. There he abides, 
        awaiting the opportune moment to appear on earth as a Sammà Sambuddha.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is not correct to think 
        that a Bodhisatta purposely manifests himself in such various forms in 
        order to acquire universal experience. No person is exempt from the 
        inexorable law of Kamma which alone determines the future birth of 
        individuals, except Arahants and Buddhas who have put an end to all life 
        in a fresh existence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Due to his intrinsic merit, 
        A Bodhisatta, however, possesses some special powers. If, for instance, 
        he is born in a Brahma Realm where the span of life extends for 
        countless aeons, by exercise of his will-power, he ceases to live in 
        that sphere, and is reborn in another congenial place where he may serve 
        the world and practise Pàramìs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from this kind of 
        voluntary death <i>(adhimutti-kàlakiriyà), </i>the Jàtaka Commentary 
        states that there are eighteen states in which a Bodhisatta, as the 
        result of his potential Kammic force accumulated in the course of his 
        wanderings in Samsàra, is never reborn. For instance, he is never born 
        blind or deaf, nor does he become an absolute misbeliever <i>(niyata 
        micchàditthi), </i>who<i> </i>denies Kamma and its effects. He is born 
        in the animal kingdom, but not larger than an elephant and smaller than 
        a snipe. He may suffer in the ordinary states of misery <i>(apàya), </i>but 
        is never destined to the nethermost states of woe <i>(avìci). </i>Also 
        a Bodhisatta does not seek birth in the Pure Abodes <i>(Suddhàvàsa), </i>where 
        Anàgàmis are reborn, nor in the Formless Realms where one is deprived 
        of the opportunity to be of service to others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It might be asked: Is a 
        Bodhisatta aware that he is aspiring to Buddhahood in the course of his 
        births?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, he is, and at 
        times he is not.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to certain 
        Jàtakas it appears that on some occasions the Bodhisatta <i>Gotama </i>was 
        fully conscious of his striving for Buddhahood. Visayha Setthi Jàtaka 
        (No. 34O) may be cited as an example. In this particular story <i>Sakka </i>questioned 
        the Bodhisatta as to why he was exceptionally generous. He replied that 
        it was not for the sake of any worldly power, but for the sole purpose 
        of attaining Supreme Buddhahood. In certain births as in the case of 
        Jotipàla (Majjhima Nikàya, Ghatikàra Sutta, No. 81), he was not only 
        unaware of his high aspiration, but also abused the noble Teacher Buddha 
        <i>Kassapa </i>at the mere utterance of the sacred word-Buddha. It may 
        be mentioned that it was from this very Buddha that he obtained his last 
        revelation </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(Vivarana).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We ourselves may be 
        Bodhisattas who have dedicated our lives to the noble purpose of serving 
        the world. One need not think that the Bodhisatta Ideal is reserved only 
        for supermen. What one has done another can do, given the necessary 
        effort and enthusiasm. Let us too endeavour to work disinterestedly for 
        the good of ourselves and all others, having for our object in life -- 
        the noble ideal of service and perfection.</font></p>
