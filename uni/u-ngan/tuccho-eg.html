      <td width="100%">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>here 
        are two ways to nurture Buddhism. One is known as<i> àmisapùjà, </i>nurturing 
        through material offerings, such as the four supports of clothing, food, 
        shelter and medicines. This is nurturing Buddhism by giving material 
        support to the <i>Sangha</i> of monks and nuns so that they can live in 
        reasonable comfort, thus fostering the practice of Buddhism, which in 
        turn leads to the continued direct realization of the Buddha's teaching, 
        bringing increased prosperity to the Buddhist religion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It can be likened to a 
        tree. A tree has roots, a base, a trunk, branches and leaves. Every 
        single leaf and branch, including the trunk, depends on the roots to 
        absorb nutriment and send it up to those other parts. A tree is 
        dependent on the roots to sustain it. We are the same. Our actions and 
        our speech are the &quot;branches&quot;, &quot;twigs&quot; and 
        &quot;trunk&quot;. The &quot;mind&quot; is the root which absorbs 
        nutriment and sends it out to sustain the &quot;trunk&quot;, 
        &quot;branches&quot; and &quot;leaves&quot; which in turn bear fruit. 
        Whatever state the mind is in, be it based in wrong view or right view, 
        it expresses that wrong view or right view outwardly also, through our 
        actions and speech.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the nurturing of 
        Buddhism through the practical application of the Teachings is very 
        important, in fact there is nothing else to it. For instance, in the 
        ceremony of determining the precepts on observance days, the Ajahn 
        describes those unskillful actions which laypeople should refrain from. 
        But if one simply determines the precepts without meditating on or 
        contemplating their meaning, progress is difficult. One will be unable 
        to establish oneself in the true practice. The real nurturing of 
        Buddhism is therefore achieved through <i>patipatipùjà -- </i>the 
        &quot;offering&quot;of practice. Establish true Restraint <i>(sìla), </i>true 
        Concentration <i>(samàdhi) </i>and true Wisdom <i>(pannà), </i>then 
        one will know what it's all about. If one doesn't understand through 
        practice one won't understand Buddhism. Even if one learns the whole <i>Tipitaka 
        </i>[The voluminous recorded teachings of the Buddha], one still won't 
        know.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the Buddha 
        there was a monk known as Tuccho Pothila. Tuccho Pothila was very 
        astute, thoroughly learned in the scriptures and texts. He had eighteen 
        branch monasteries and was an eminent teacher, so famous that people all 
        about revered him. When people heard the name &quot;Tuccho Pothila&quot; 
        they were awe-struck and nobody would dare question anything he taught, 
        so much were they in awe of his command of the Teachings. Tuccho Pothila 
        was one disciple in the Buddha's time who was eminent in learning.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One day he went to visit 
        the Buddha. As he was paying his respects, the Buddha said: &quot;Ah, so 
        you've come, Venerable Empty Scripture!&quot;...just like that! They 
        spoke for a while about this and that, and then, when it was time to 
        take leave of the Buddha and return to his monastery... &quot;Ah, going 
        back to your monastery, Venerable Empty Scripture?&quot; That was all He 
        said. When Tuccho Pothila arrived, &quot;Ah, so you've come, Venerable 
        Empty Scripture!&quot;... when it was time for him to go, &quot;Ah, so 
        you're going now, Venerable Empty Scripture!&quot; He didn't expand on 
        it, that was all the teaching the Buddha gave. Tuccho Pothila was an 
        eminent teacher, so he thought to himself, &quot;Now why did the Lord 
        Buddha say that? What did he mean?&quot; He thought and thought, 
        contemplating and going over everything he had learnt, until he 
        realized.... &quot;Oh, what the Buddha said is true -- 'Venerable Empty 
        Scripture' -- a monk who only studies but has never practised.&quot; 
        When he looked into his heart he saw that really he was no different 
        from lay people. Whatever lay people aspired to he also aspired to. 
        Whatever lay people enjoyed he also enjoyed. There was no real <i>&quot;samana&quot; 
        </i>[a renunciate - literally, &quot;peaceful one&quot;] within him. 
        There was no really profound quality within his mind which could firmly 
        establish him in the Way and provide true peace.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So he decided to practise 
        ... but there was nowhere he could go to. All the teachers he went to 
        see were his own students, so they wouldn't accept him. Usually when 
        people meet their teacher they become timid and reverential, they don't 
        dare speak. So nobody would accept him. He had a lot of learning, a lot 
        of knowledge, so nobody would accept him as a student. Nobody would dare 
        teach or instruct him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Finally he went to see a 
        certain boy novice, who was enlightened, and asked to practise under 
        him. The novice said, &quot;Yes, sure you can practise with me .... if 
        you sincerely want to practise. But if you are not sincere I won't 
        accept you.&quot; So Tuccho Pothila pledged his life as a student of the 
        novice.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The novice then told him to 
        put on all his robes. Now there happened to be a muddy bog nearby. When 
        Tuccho Pothila had neatly put on all his robes the novice said, 
        &quot;Okay, now run down into this muddy bog. If I don't tell you to 
        stop, don't stop. If I don't tell you to come up, don't come up. Okay... 
        run!&quot; Tuccho Pothila, neatly robed, plunged into the bog ... 
        squelch! squelch! squelch! The novice didn't tell him to stop and so he 
        kept running until he was completely covered in mud. Finally the novice 
        said, &quot;Okay, you can stop&quot; ... so he stopped... &quot;Okay 
        .... come on up!&quot;... so he came out.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This clearly showed that he 
        had given up personal pride. He was ready to accept teaching. If he 
        hadn't been ready to learn he wouldn't have run into the bog, a teacher 
        of such eminence, but he agreed to do it. The boy novice, seeing this, 
        knew that Tuccho Pothila was really determined to practise.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When Tuccho Pothila had 
        come up, the novice taught him. He taught him to observe the sense 
        objects; to know the mind and to know the sense objects. The novice used 
        the simile of a certain man catching a lizard which had run into a 
        termite mound. The mound had six holes in it. Now if the lizard had run 
        in there, how could one catch it? One would have to close off five of 
        the holes, seal them with something, and leave just one hole open. Then 
        one would have to sit and guard that one hole. When the lizard ran out 
        one could catch it. Observing the mind is similar to this. Closing off 
        the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue and the body, one leaves only 
        the mind. To &quot;close off&quot; the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body 
        means to restrain and compose them, observing only the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is the same as 
        catching the lizard. For instance, when noting the breath, there is <i>sati. 
        Sati </i>is the quality of recollection, as in asking &quot;What am I 
        doing?&quot; <i>Sampajanna </i>is the self-awareness that &quot;now I am 
        doing such and-such&quot;. One observes the in-and-out breathing with <i>sati, 
        </i>recollection, and <i>sampajanna, </i>self-awareness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That quality of 
        recollection is something that arises in the mind, it's not something 
        that can be learnt from somewhere else. Know the feelings that arise. 
        Perhaps the mind is fairly inactive and then a feeling arises ... There! 
        That's a feeling. <i>Sati</i>. goes hand-in-hand with those feelings. So 
        there is <i>sati, </i>the recollection that &quot;I will speak&quot;, 
        &quot;I will do&quot;, &quot;I will come&quot;, &quot;I will go&quot;, 
        &quot;I will sit&quot; and so on. This is <i>sati, </i>recollection. <i>Sampajanna 
        </i>is the awareness that &quot;now I am walking&quot;, &quot;I am 
        sitting&quot;, &quot;I am lying down&quot;, &quot;I am experiencing 
        such-and such a mood.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With these two things, <i>sati, 
        </i>recollection and <i>sampajanna, </i>knowing oneself in that act of 
        recollection, one will be able to know the activity of mind in the 
        present moment. When it receives such-and-such an impression how does it 
        react? We will know this.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That which is aware of 
        those impressions is called &quot;mind&quot; <i>(citta). </i>The 
        impression <i>(àrammana) </i>is that which &quot;wanders into&quot; the 
        mind. For instance, there is a sound, like the sound of the electric 
        plane here. It enters through the ear and travels inwards. The mind 
        acknowledges that it is the sound of an electric plane. That which 
        acknowledges the sound is called &quot;mind&quot;. Now this mind which 
        acknowledges the sound is still quite coarse. It's just the everyday 
        mind. Perhaps we hear the sound of the plane and annoyance arises within 
        the one who acknowledges. We must further train this &quot;one who 
        acknowledges&quot; to be &quot;one who knows in accordance with the 
        truth&quot;, <i>buddho. </i>If we don't clearly know in accordance with 
        the truth then we may get annoyed at the sounds of people, of cars, of 
        the electric plane or whatever. This is just the ordinary mind which 
        acknowledges annoyance. It knows in accordance with our interpretations, 
        not in accordance with the truth. We must train the mind to know with <i>nànadassana, 
        </i>the power of the refined mind, so that it knows that the sound of 
        the electric plane is simply sound. If we don't cling to it then it 
        won't annoy us at all. The sound arises and we simply know it. This is 
        called truly knowing the arising of sense objects. If we develop the <i>buddho, 
        </i>if we have clear realisation of the sound of the plane, then the 
        sound doesn't annoy us. It just arises according to conditions. The 
        sound is not a being, an individual, a self, an &quot;us&quot; or 
        &quot;them&quot;. It's just sound. The mind &quot;turns over&quot;, it 
        lets go.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we know in this way, 
        this knowing is called <i>buddho. </i>It is the knowledge that is 
        penetrating, clear, it knows the truth. We can just let the sound go on 
        its way. It doesn't disturb us unless we cling to it, thinking, 
        &quot;Oh, I'm annoyed at that sound. I don't want to hear people speak 
        like that. I don't want to hear sounds like that.&quot; So suffering 
        arises. Right here is the cause of suffering. What is the cause of 
        suffering? It's that we don't know the truth of the matter, we haven't 
        developed <i>buddho, </i>we are not yet clear, not yet awakened, not yet 
        aware<b>. </b>There is just the raw, unpurified mind. It is the mind 
        which is not yet truly useful.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the Buddha taught 
        to train the mind, train it to be strong. Strengthening the mind and 
        strengthening the body are similar, but are done in different ways. To 
        exercise the body we must move it around, massage it, stretch it, jog in 
        the morning and evening and so on. This is called exercising the body. 
        The body thus becomes stronger, more nimble, the respiratory and nervous 
        systems become more efficient than if we hadn't exercised.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Strengthening the mind is 
        not done by making it move around as is done to strengthen the body, but 
        by bringing the mind to a halt, bringing it to rest. For instance, when 
        we practise <i>samàdhi, </i>we take an object, such as the in-and-out 
        breathing, as our base. This will be the focus of our attention and 
        contemplation. We note the breathing. To note means that we follow the 
        breathing with our awareness, note its coming in and going out, note its 
        rhythm. We put awareness into the breath, we follow the natural 
        in-and-out breathing and try to let go of all else. Our mind will become 
        energized because it has only one object of attention. If we just let 
        the mind think of this, that and the other there are many objects of 
        attention, the mind doesn't unify. The mind won't stop.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we say that the mind 
        stops, we mean that it feels as if it's stopped, it doesn't go running 
        about here and there. It's as if we have a sharp knife. If we go and cut 
        away at things at random like stones, bricks and grass, without choosing 
        carefully, our knife will quickly become blunt. We must cut only those 
        things which are useful to cut. Our mind is the same. If we let our mind 
        wander after thoughts or feelings which have no use or value, the mind 
        will become weak because it has no chance to rest. If the mind has no 
        energy, wisdom will not arise, because the mind without energy is a mind 
        without </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">samàdhi.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the mind hasn't stopped 
        then one can't clearly perceive the sense objects. <b>The knowledge that 
        the mind is</b> <b>the mind, the object is the object, is the root from 
        which</b> </font><b><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism has been able 
        to grow. It is the heart of Buddhism.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We must cultivate this 
        mind, develop it. We cultivate <i>samatha </i>(Calm), and <i>vipassanà </i>(Insight).<i> 
        </i>We train this mind to have restraint and wisdom <i>(sìla-dhamma)</i> 
        by letting the mind stop, by allowing wisdom to arise in the mind, by 
        knowing the truth of it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Actually you know, we human 
        beings, the way we do things, the way we live, the way we are, are 
        really like little children. A child doesn't know anything. If an adult 
        observes the actions of a child, the way it plays and jumps around, its 
        actions don't seem to serve much purpose. If our mind is untrained it is 
        like a child. One speaks without awareness and acts without wisdom. One 
        may degenerate but not know it; one may go bad but not know it. A child 
        is ignorant, it just plays as children do, and our ignorant mind is the 
        same.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore this mind should 
        be trained. The Buddha taught to train this mind, to teach this mind. 
        Even though we may nurture Buddhism with the four supports, this is only 
        superficial, it is only the &quot;bark&quot; or the &quot;softwood&quot; 
        of the tree. The real nurturing of Buddhism is the practice, nothing 
        else, the training of our actions, speech and mind according to the 
        teachings, which in turn has far-reaching consequences. If we are 
        straight and honest, if we have restraint and wisdom, our practice will 
        bring only prosperity in the future. There will be no cause for jealousy 
        or hostility. The religion teaches us to be like this. Understand it in 
        this way.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we determine the 
        precepts simply in order to follow the established custom, then even 
        though what the Ajahn says is true, we are still lacking in the 
        practice. We may be able to repeat the teachings and to study them, but 
        it remains for us to practise them in order to really understand. If 
        this practice, <i>patipatipùjà, </i>does not come about, this may well 
        be the cause for our not penetrating to the<i> Buddha, Dhamma </i>and <i>Sangha 
        </i>for many lifetimes, or one can simply say that we won't know a thing 
        about the real essence of this Buddhist religion. It's as if we had a 
        certain fruit which was said to be sweet or tasty, a good strain of 
        fruit, but having planted it, when it blossoms we don't smell the 
        blossom; the fruit ripens and we don't eat the fruit. That fruit isn't 
        much use to us. No matter how good a strain it is, we won't know it if 
        we haven't yet experienced the taste of that fruit. Buddhism is like 
        this. If we don't reflect, then we won't understand the meaning of 
        giving <i>(dàna),<b> </b></i>restraint <i>(sìla),<b> </b></i>or 
        meditation </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(bhàvanà).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the practice is 
        like a key, the key of meditation. If we have the right key in our hand, 
        no matter how tightly closed the lock is, when we take the key and turn 
        it, that's all that's needed. If the lock has no key then it's useless 
        to us. Whatever is in the trunk we can't get at it. That's why the 
        Buddha taught us to study and know these things.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Actually there are two 
        kinds of knowledge. One who knows the <i>Dhamma</i> doesn't simply speak 
        from memory, he speaks the truth. Worldly people usually speak from 
        memory, and what's more they usually speak out of vanity. For example, 
        suppose there was a certain person who we hadn't seen for a long time, 
        suppose we had lived in different countries or different provinces for a 
        long time, and then one day we happened to meet on the train... 
        &quot;Oh, I'm so glad to see you! I was just thinking to look you up!... 
        Actually it's not so at all. Actually one hadn't even thought of them, 
        but one says so at the time simply out of gladness. And so it becomes a 
        lie. Yes, it's lying out of heedlessness. Really one hadn't thought of 
        visiting that person at all, the thought had never crossed one's mind, 
        but a feeling arises at the time and one speaks accordingly. One lies at 
        that time. This is lying without knowing it. This happens too, it's a 
        kind of defilement. The mind concocts the feeling which causes us to say 
        it. This is a refined form of lying, and actually people tend to speak 
        like this.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So with regard to the mind, 
        Tuccho Pothila followed the teachings of the novice: breathing in, 
        breathing out... contemplating with <i>sati </i>and<i> sampajanna, </i>with 
        thorough awareness ... until he saw the liar within him, the lying of 
        his own mind. He saw the defilements as they came up, just like the 
        lizard coming out of the termite mound. As soon as they arose he saw 
        them, he perceived their nature. He saw that one minute the mind would 
        create one thing, the next it would concoct another; creating in this 
        way, concocting in that.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking is a <i>sankhata 
        dhamma, </i>something which is created or concocted from supporting 
        conditions. It's not <i>asankhata dhamma, </i>that which is neither 
        created nor concocted. The mind which has been well trained, has good 
        awareness, does not concoct or create mental states. One doesn't have to 
        believe others, one has penetrated to the truth, known as the <i>ariyasacca 
        </i>(the Four Noble Truths). Knowing according to the <i>ariyasacca </i>is 
        knowing according to the truth. One's mental creations will try to get 
        around it and say &quot;that's good&quot; or &quot;this is 
        beautiful&quot; or whatever, but if there is <i>Buddho</i> in one's mind 
        it can no longer lie to one, because one knows the truth of the mind 
        already. It can't create any more deluded mental states. One sees all 
        mental states as unstable, as unsatisfactory, and that one who clings to 
        those mental states will suffer because they are not lasting.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Wherever he went, the One 
        Who Knows was constantly there. Tuccho Pothila came to this 
        understand-ing. He looked at the mental states as they arose in the 
        mind, he looked at the various creations of the mind. He saw that the 
        mind lied in many ways. He saw the truth of the matter. He grasped the 
        essence of the practice by seeing that &quot;Oh, this liar here is the 
        one to watch. Just this is what leads us to extremes of happiness and 
        sadness, making us spin around in this cycle of <i>samsàra</i> with its 
        happiness, unhappiness, good and evil. All because of this one.&quot; 
        Tuccho Pothila saw the truth of the matter, he was able to grasp the 
        point, just like the man who caught the lizard. He grasped the workings 
        of the deluded mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is the same for us. 
        There is just this one mind which is the important thing. So it is said 
        that we should train this mind. But if the mind is the mind, what are we 
        going to train it with? If we have <i>sati </i>and<i> sampajanna </i>constantly 
        we will know the mind. The One Who Knows is a step further beyond the 
        mind. It is that which knows the state of the mind. The mind is the 
        mind. That which knows the mind as simply mind, that is the One Who 
        Knows. It is above the mind. The One Who Knows is above the mind and 
        that is how it is able to look after the mind, to teach the mind to know 
        what is right and what is wrong. In the end it all comes down to this 
        mind, to this concocting mind. If it is enmeshed in its concoctions and 
        there is no awareness beyond it then the mind will be spiritually 
        barren.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So we must use this mind to 
        hear the Teachings, to cultivate <i>buddho, </i>the clear and radiant 
        awareness, that which exists above and beyond our ordinary mind and 
        knows all that goes on within it. That is why the Buddha taught us to 
        cultivate and meditate on the word <i>buddho, </i>until we know the mind 
        and know beyond the mind. Just observe all the mind's movements, whether 
        good or bad, until the One Who Knows perceives that mind is simply mind, 
        it's not a person or a self. This is called <i>cittànupassanà </i>(Contemplation 
        of Mind). If one sees in this way one sees that the mind is <i>aniccam,</i> 
        <i>dukkham </i>and<i> anattà. </i>This mind still doesn't belong to us, 
        it can still lie to us.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So we can summarise the 
        above thus: the mind is that which acknowledges sense objects. The sense 
        objects are the sense objects and the mind we call &quot;mind&quot;. The 
        One Who Knows both the mind and the sense objects is beyond both.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And there is that which 
        constantly purifies: it's known as<i> sati. </i>Everybody has <i>sati, </i>even 
        a cat has <i>sati </i>when it is going to catch a mouse. A dog has it 
        when it barks at or bites people. That's a form of <i>sati </i>also, but 
        it's not <i>sati</i> according to <i>dhamma. </i>Everybody has <i>sati, </i>but 
        it's like when we say to contemplate the body...</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What is there to 
        contemplate in this body?&quot; they say, &quot;Anybody can see it! <i>Kesà 
        </i>we can see, <i>lomà </i>we can see, <i>nakhà </i>we can see ... 
        Hair, nails, teeth and skin ... we can see them already, so what?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That's how people are. They 
        can see it alright but their seeing is incomplete, they don't see with 
        the <i>buddho, </i>the One Who Knows, the Awakened One. They only see 
        the body in the natural way, they only see the body visually. Simply to 
        see the body is not enough. If one merely sees the body there's trouble. 
        One must further see the body within the body, then things become 
        clearer. If one merely sees the body one gets fooled by it, one is 
        charmed by the beauty of it. One doesn't see <i>aniccam, dukkham </i>and 
        <i>anattà, </i>so<i> kàmacchanda </i>(delight in objects of the 
        senses) arises. One is still fascinated by forms, sounds, smells, tastes 
        and bodily sensations. Seeing in this way is seeing with the mundane eye 
        of the flesh. One only knows that one loves this person and hates that 
        person, that this is beautiful and that's not. The Buddha taught that 
        this is not enough. One must see with the &quot;mind's eye&quot; as 
        well. See the body within the body. If one looks within the body, 
        looking inward at what is there ... Ugh! It's really repulsive. There 
        are things from today in there and things from yesterday, one can't tell 
        what's what. In this way one will see more clearly than by simply 
        looking with the eye. Contemplate, observe with the eye of the mind, 
        with the Wisdom Eye. See with wisdom.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore outlooks can 
        differ like this. Some people, if taught to contemplate <i>kesà, lomà, 
        nakhà, dantà, taco,</i> don't know what there is to contemplate. They 
        say they can see all those things already, but they see only with the 
        flesh-eye, with this madman's eye. It only looks at what it wants to 
        look at, what isn't attractive it won't have anything to do with. It 
        picks and chooses like this. When we say to &quot;see the body within 
        the body&quot; it means to see more clearly than that.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This practice is the one 
        which can uproot clinging to the five<i> khandhas [*]. </i>If one 
        uproots attachment, it's just the same as if one were uprooting 
        suffering because those five <i>khandhas </i>are the base of suffering. 
        If suffering arises it arises here, at the clinging to the five <i>khandhas. 
        </i>It's not that the five <i>khandhas </i>in themselves are suffering, 
        but the clinging to the five <i>khandhas, </i>attaching to them as being 
        oneself ... that's suffering. If one clearly sees the truth of the 
        matter through meditation, then suffering will become 
        &quot;unwound&quot;, just like a screw or a bolt. One unwinds it and it 
        withdraws. It's not tightly fixed, not taut as when we screw it 
        clockwise. The mind withdraws like this, it lets go, it relinquishes. 
        It's not tightly bound within good and evil, within possessions, praise 
        and blame, status, happiness or suffering.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">[*] The five Khandas, or 
        aggregates, which go to make up what we call a &quot;person&quot;: Rùpa 
        -- body, material form, Vedanà -- feeling, Sannà -- memory or 
        perception, Sankhàra -- mental formations, Vinnàna consciousness.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we don't know the truth 
        of these things it's like tightening the screw all the time. One screws 
        it down until it's crushing one, one suffers over everything. If one 
        knows what's what with these things it's like unwinding the screw. In <i>Dhamma</i> 
        language this is called the arising of <i>nibbida,</i> disenchantment. 
        One is weary of those things so one lays down the fascination, 
        infatuation and attachment to them. And if one &quot;unwinds&quot; the 
        clinging to those things one is really at peace.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For example, with regard to 
        the head. In Thailand here the head is really important, one can't touch 
        it. If one touched a person's head in the street he'd probably bash you. 
        This is because he hasn't consented. But if the person has consented, 
        like the military officers who come to see me, then it's okay. I can 
        touch their heads and it's okay, they even like it. However they only 
        agree to it on<b> </b>that occasion. If I met them in the street and 
        touched their heads they might clobber me! Here is where suffering 
        arises, at clinging.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I've been to some overseas 
        countries where people, regardless of sex, can just go and touch each 
        other's heads, and actually they're right in a way, too. If one doesn't 
        cling then it's really all right. When one comes to Thailand, one can 
        touch a person's knee and there's no offence, we don't regard that as 
        important, but when it comes to touching someone's head we really take 
        offence, it's really important. This is clinging. Actually all the parts 
        of our body are the same, but this is one part we really hold onto and 
        so tie ourselves up with more and more attachments,</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That's the cause. That's 
        the cause for the arising of suffering. So we should get rid of the 
        cause, cut off its root and not allow it to be a base for suffering to 
        arise. For example, if one contemplates the body, it's all the same. The 
        lower parts, the sides and the head are all much the same. If one thinks 
        about it, even if someone were to come and slap one's face it's all the 
        same, it doesn't matter. This is to be one who has let go of the cause 
        of suffering. People only have this one problem: the problem of 
        clinging. Just because of this one thing people will kill each other. 
        Just because of this, nothing more. Whether talking about individual, 
        family or national problems, there's nothing else. Nobody wins ... they 
        kill each other but in the end no-one gets anything. I don't know why 
        they go on like that, just killing each other pointlessly.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There's power, possessions, 
        status, praise, happiness and suffering. These are the Worldly <i>Dhammas</i>, 
        the <i>dhammas</i> which swamp worldly beings. Worldly beings are led 
        around by the Worldly Dhammas: gain and loss; status and loss of status; 
        praise and criticism; happiness and suffering. These <i>dhammas</i> are 
        insidious, they lead to trouble. If one doesn't reflect on their true 
        nature one will suffer. One could even commit murder for wealth, status 
        or power. And why? Because if we don't understand them we take them too 
        seriously. One is appointed to this or that position, perhaps head of 
        the village or city councillor, this or that ... and one 
        &quot;becomes&quot; that position. An old man once told me about a 
        certain obnoxious village head man. After they had appointed him as head 
        of the village he became &quot;power-drunk&quot;. If his old friends 
        came to see him for a chat he wouldn't associate with them as before. 
        He'd say, &quot;Don't come round here now, things aren't the same 
        anymore.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Be it possessions, status, 
        praise or happiness the Buddha taught to understand their nature. Take 
        those things as they come and let them be. Don't be changed by them. If 
        one doesn't really understand possessions, status, praise, criticism and 
        so on one may even kill over them; one becomes fooled by one's power, by 
        one's children and relatives, by everything. If one understands them 
        clearly one knows that they're all much the same. They are only 
        impermanent conditions, and yet when clung to they become defiled. They 
        are called worldly<i> Dhammas</i>. Worldly beings are led around by 
        these things. There is the Buddha's teaching which states that all these 
        things arise subsequently. When people are first born there are simply <i>rùpa 
        </i>(form) and <i>nàma </i>(mentality), that's all. We add on the 
        &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; or whatever later. This is done according to 
        convention. Still later we add on the business of General or Colonel or 
        whatever. If one doesn't really know these things one thinks they are 
        real and so carries them around. One &quot;carries&quot; possessions, 
        status, name and reputation around. If one has power, one calls all the 
        tunes, one can do anything ... take this person and execute him. Take 
        that one and throw him in jail ... One has power because of one's rank. 
        This word &quot;rank&quot; here is where <i>upadàna, </i>clinging, 
        takes hold. As soon as one gets rank one starts giving orders. Right or 
        wrong, one just acts on one's own power, on one's own moods. So one just 
        goes on making the same old mistakes, deviating further and further from 
        </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If one already knows the 
        practice of <i>Dhamma</i> one won't behave like that. Good and evil have 
        been in this world since who knows when ... when possessions and status 
        accrue to us then let them be simply the possessions, simply the status, 
        but don't let them become one's identity. Just use them to fulfill one's 
        obligations and leave it at that. One is just as before. If we have 
        meditated on these things no matter what accrues to us we won't be 
        fooled by it. We will be untroubled, unaffected, constant. Everything is 
        pretty much the same, there's not a great deal to it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is how the Buddha 
        wanted us to contemplate in order to know the truth of things. No matter 
        what one receives, the mind has nothing to concoct or add onto it. They 
        appoint one as city councillor ... Okay, sure I'm the city councillor 
        but I'm not.They appoint one as head of the village ... &quot;Okay, so I 
        am ... but I'm not!&quot; Whatever they make of you ... &quot;yes, I am 
        ... but I'm not!&quot;. In the end what are we anyway? We all just die 
        in the end. Whether they appoint one as city councillor or village 
        headman, in the end it's all the same. What can one say? If one can see 
        it like this one will be really content, firm and stable. Nothing is 
        changed. This is to be one who isn't fooled. Whatever they give us 
        it’s just that; simply <i>sankhàra. </i>There's nothing which can 
        lead this mind to create or concoct, there's nothing which can seduce it 
        again. There are no longer any conditions which can seduce the mind into 
        <i>ràga</i> (Lust),<i> dosa </i>(Aversion), or <i>moha </i>(Delusion).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now this is to be one who 
        is nurturing Buddhism. Whether we are among those who are being nurtured 
        (the <i>Sangha)</i> or those who are nurturing (the laity) let us 
        thoroughly consider this. Let the <i>sìla-dhamma </i>arise within us.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In short: This is the 
        surest way to nurture Buddhism. To nurture it by giving food, shelter 
        and medicine are correct also, but they are only correct in so far as 
        the &quot;soft-wood&quot; of Buddhism is concerned. All you lay devotees 
        who have come to listen to <i>Dhamma</i> and cultivate good tendencies 
        today should not forget this. A tree has bark, softwood and heartwood. 
        These three parts are inter-dependent. There is heartwood due to the 
        presence of the bark. There is the bark because of the softwood. There 
        is softwood due to the heartwood. They come together just like the Three 
        Teachings of <i>sìla, samàdhi</i> and <i>pannà. Sìla </i>is 
        establishing one's speech and actions in uprightness. <i>Samàdhi </i>is 
        firmly fixing the mind. <i>Pannà</i> is thorough understanding of the <i>sankhàras. 
        </i>Study this, practise this and one will be one who nurtures Buddhism 
        in the most profound way.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we don't realize these 
        things within us then if one has many possessions one will be fooled by 
        them; if one has status one will be fooled by it; whatever one has one 
        will be fooled by it. That's the way it is. If we only nurture Buddhism 
        in the external way, the arguments and squabbling will never cease, the 
        building of grudges and feuds between people will never cease, the 
        stabbing and shooting will never cease. If they are to cease we must 
        contemplate the matter of possessions, status, praise, happiness and 
        suffering. We - must contemplate our practice and bring it into line 
        with <i>sìla-dhamma. We</i> should reflect that all beings in the world 
        are parts of one whole. We are like them, they are like us. They have 
        happiness, they have suffering, and so do we. It's all much the same. If 
        one contemplates in this way, peace and understanding will arise. This 
        is the foundation of Buddh-ism. One who nurtures Buddhism must develop <i>sìla, 
        samàdhi </i>and<i> pannà </i>until they are constantly with one. This 
        is to be one who nurtures Buddhism in the right way.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On this occasion the 
        expounding of <i>Dhamma</i> seems to be adequate for now. Finally may 
        you all set your minds firm on contemplating what you have heard today 
        so that you can nurture Buddhism with the true practice.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">May you all be happy!</font></p>
