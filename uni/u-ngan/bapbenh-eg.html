        Death is certain&quot;</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a well known saying 
        to Buddhism. Knowing very well that death is certain and it is a natural 
        phenomenon that everyone has to face, we should not be afraid of death. 
        Yet, instinctively, all of<i> </i>us fear death because we do not know 
        how to think of its inevitability. We like to cling to our life and body 
        and so develop too much craving and attachment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A child comes into this 
        world bringing joy and happiness unto all near and dear ones. Even the 
        mother who had to bear extreme labour pains is pleased and delighted to 
        behold her new-born child. She feels that all the trouble and pain borne 
        by her were well worth it. However, by crying, the child seems to 
        suggest it too has its share of suffering for coming into this world. 
        The child grows into an adolescent and later into an adult, performing 
        all sorts of good and bad deeds. He eventually grows old and finally 
        bids farewell to this world leaving his kith and kin in deep sorrow. 
        Such is the nature of existence of a human being. People try to evade 
        and escape from the clutches of death but no one is able to do so. At 
        the moment of death, they have their minds hovering over their hoard of 
        acquired wealth, unduly worrying about their dear children surrounding 
        them. Last but not least, they keep evincing much concern over their own 
        precious bodies, which, despite the tender care and attention, lavished 
        by them are now worn out, decaying and exhausted. It grieves one's heart 
        to separate oneself from the body. It is unbearable though unavoidable. 
        This is the way most people take leave of this world -- with moans and 
        groans. The pangs of death are considered dreadful, an attitude fed by 
        ignorance.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Fear of Death</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Men are disturbed not by 
        external things, but by beliefs and imaginations they conjure up in 
        their minds with regard to the form of their future Iives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Death, for example, is not 
        by itself dreadful: the dread or terror exists only in our minds. It is 
        not often that we are brave enough to come face to face with the thought 
        of our own mortality. Insistence upon the truth of suffering may seem 
        horrible and unacceptable to the mind which is unable to face realities, 
        but it certainly helps to reduce or eliminate the dread of fear by 
        knowing how to face death. Once life is launched, like a bullet it 
        rushes to its destination -- death. Realising thus, we must bravely face 
        that natural occurrence. To be considered free in life, we must also be 
        free from the fear of death. Fear only comes to those who are not able 
        to comprehend the laws of Nature. <b>'Wheresoever</b> <b>fear arises, it 
        arises in the fool, not in the wise</b> <b>man,&quot; </b>says the 
        Buddha in the <i>Anguttara Nik√†ya. </i>Fears are nothing more than 
        states of mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Remember what science 
        teaches us about the process of dying? It is only a physiological 
        erosion of the human body. We needlessly frighten ourselves with 
        imagined or anticipated horrors which never come to pass. As a famous 
        physician, Sir William Osler puts it:-</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In my wide clinical 
        experience, most human</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">beings 
        die really without pain or fear.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A veteran nurse once said: 
        &quot;It has always seemed to me a major tragedy that so many people go 
        through life haunted by the fear of death -- only to find when it comes 
        that it's as natural as life itself. For few are afraid to die when they 
        get to the very end. In all my experience only one seemed to feel any 
        terror -<i>- </i>a woman who had done her sister a wicked thing which it 
        was too late to put right.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Something strange and 
        beautiful happens to men and women when they come to the end of the 
        road. All fear, all horror disappears. I have often watched a look of 
        happy wonder dawn in their eyes when they realise this is true. It is 
        all part of the goodness of Nature.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Attachment to life on earth 
        creates the unnatural fear of death. It creates strong anxiety on life; 
        the man who will never take risks even for what is right. He lives in 
        fear worrying that some illness or accident might snuff out the precious 
        little life he cherishes. Realizing that death is inevitable, the one 
        who loves life on earth will go into a devout prayer expressing the hope 
        that his soul will survive 'in heaven. No man can be happy in such a 
        tempest of fear and hope. Yet it is hard to despise or ignore these 
        manifestations of the instinct for self-preservation. There is however a 
        method of overcoming this fear. Forget the concept of self; turn one's 
        love of the inward outwards, i.e. provide humanitarian service and to 
        shower love on others. Whoever constantly keeps in mind the fact that he 
        would someday be subjected to death and that death is inevitable, would 
        be eager to fulfil his duties to his fellow human beings before death, 
        and this would certainly make him heedful in respect of this world and 
        the next. Being engrossed in service to others, you will soon release 
        yourself from the heavy selfish attachments, hopes, vanity, pride and 
        self-righteousness.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Illness and Death</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Both illness and death are 
        natural happenings in our lives and must be accepted as such with 
        understanding. According to modern psychological theory, undue mental 
        stress is caused by our refusal to face and accept life's realities. 
        This undue stress, unless overcome or subdued, actually causes grave 
        physical illness. Maintaining a sense of undue worry and despair over an 
        illness will certainly make it worse.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As for death, it must never 
        be feared by those who are pure in heart and action. We are all a<i> </i>combination 
        of mind and matter and as such there is actually no individual self to 
        die. The kammic reactions arising from past evil deeds may linger with 
        us on our rebirth thus causing us to shoulder the kammic sufferings in a 
        new life. Such an eventuality can be obviated if we make every effort to 
        acquire merit by leading a virtuous life and by doing meritorious deeds 
        wherever and whenever possible. By doing so we can face death bravely 
        and realistically since in accordance with the teachings of Buddhism 
        there is no &quot;saviour&quot; upon whom we could entrust our burdens 
        in order to relieve ourselves from the consequences of our wrong 
        actions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We should constantly remind 
        ourselves of the Buddha's advice:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Be ye refuges and 
          islands unto yourselves;</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> <i>labour 
          on with diligence.&quot;</i></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists should not go 
        into grief and deep mourning over the deaths of relatives and friends. 
        There can be no halting of the wheel of circumstance. When a man<i> </i>dies, 
        the kammic sequence of his conduct passes on into a new being. Kith and 
        kin, friends and relatives can accompany the dead body up to the grave, 
        but not further. Only a man's deeds, good or bad, go forth with him. 
        Those left behind should bear their bereavement with calmness and 
        understanding. Death is an inevitable process of this world. That is the 
        one thing which is certain in this universe. Forests may be turned into 
        cities and cities into sand dunes. Where mountains exist, a lake may be 
        formed. Uncertainty exists everywhere but death is certain. All else is 
        momentary. We had our forefathers, and they in their turn had their own, 
        but where are they all now? They have all passed away.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let not the sophisticated 
        assume that a pessimistic view of life is being presented here. This is 
        the most realistic view of all realisms. Why should we be unrealistic 
        and blind our eyes to real facts? For does not death consume everything? 
        It certainly does. Let this not be forgotten. The role of death is to 
        make every man aware of his destiny; that however high he may be placed, 
        whatever advanced aid in technology or medical science he may have, his 
        end is all the same, either in a coffin or merely reduced to a handful 
        of ashes. The sequence of birth and death is a continuing process until 
        we become perfect.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Man's Influence Persists</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said: <i>&quot;Man's 
        body turns to dust, but his name or influence persists.&quot;</i> The 
        influence of a past life is sometimes more far-reaching, more potent 
        than that held by the living body with certain limitations. We 
        occasionally act on thoughts inspired by personalities whose mortal 
        remains have turned to dust. In our accomplishments, such thoughts also 
        play an important role. Every living person is deemed a composite of all 
        his ancestors who have gone before him. In this sense, we may assume 
        that the past heroes, great philosophers, sages, poets and musicians of 
        every race are still with us. As we link our selves to the past martyrs 
        and thinkers, we are able to share their wise thoughts, their noble 
        ideals and even the imperishable music of the ages. Even though their 
        bodies are dead, their influence lives on. The body is nothing but an 
        abstract generalisation for a constantly changing combination of 
        chemical constituents. Man must realize that his life is but a drop in 
        an ever-flowing river and must be happy to contribute his part to the 
        great stream which is called life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Not knowing the nature of 
        his life, man is sunk in the mud of ignorance of this world. He weeps 
        and wails. But when he realises what his true nature is, he renounces 
        all transient things and seeks the Eternal state. Prior to achieving the 
        Eternal state he will have to face death again and again. Since death 
        itself is meaningless, man should not try to overcome the continuous 
        repeated births and deaths.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism, this 
        is not the first and last life we have in this world. If you do good 
        with confidence, you can have a better futurelife. On the other hand, if 
        you feel that you do not want to be reborn again and again, you should 
        work towards this end by making every effort to develop the mind by 
        eradicating all craving and other mental impurities.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist Philosophy</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Noble saint who has 
        attained the stage of highest perfection does not weep at the passing 
        away of those dear and near to him as he has completely eradicated his 
        emotional feelings. Ven. Anuruddha, who was an Arahant, did not weep at 
        the passing away of the Buddha. However, Ven. ≈ínanda, who was at that 
        time only a Sot√†panna, having attained only the first stage of 
        sainthood, could not but express his deep sorrow. The weeping bhikkhu 
        had to be reminded of the Buddha's view on situations of this nature, as 
        follows:- &quot;Has not the Buddha told us, √Änanda, that what is born, 
        what comes to being, and what is put together, is subject to 
        dissolution? That is the nature of all conditioned formations; to arise 
        and pass away -- Having once arisen they must pass away -- And when such 
        formations cease completely, then comes Peace Supreme.&quot; These words 
        describe the foundation on which the structure of Buddhist philosophy is 
        built.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Cause of Sorrow</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The cause of our grief and 
        sorrow is Attachment in all its various forms. If we want to overcome 
        sorrow, we have to give up attachment -- attachment not only to persons 
        but also to possessions. This is the ultimate truth; this is the lesson 
        that death signifies. Attachment provides us many things to satisfy our 
        emotion and to lead a worldly life. But the same attachment becomes in 
        the end the cause of all our sorrows. Unless we learn this lesson, death 
        can strike us and fill us with terror. The fact is beautifully 
        illustrated by the Buddha, who said: </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">- 
        &quot;Death will take away a man though he is attached to his children 
        and his possessions, just as a great flood takes away a sleeping 
        village.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This saying implies that if 
        the village had not been asleep but remained wake and alert, the havoc 
        created by the flood could have been avoided.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Death is Universal</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us now examine how the 
        Buddha solved this problem for two persons who, through attachment, were 
        both deeply grieved by death. One person was Kis√† Gotami. Her only 
        child had died after being attacked by a serpent. She went to the Buddha 
        carrying the dead child in her arms to ask for help. The Buddha asked 
        her to bring a few mustard seeds from a family where no one had died. 
        But she could not find such a family. Every house she visited was either 
        in mourning or had mourned over a death at one time or another. Then she 
        realized the bitter truth: that death is universal. Death strikes all 
        and spares none. Sorrow is the heritage of everyone.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The other person whom the 
        Buddha advised was Pat√†c√†r√†. Her case was sadder. Within a short 
        period she lost her two children, husband, brother, parents, and all her 
        possessions. Losing her senses, she ran naked and wild in the streets 
        until she met the Buddha. The Buddha brought her back to sanity by 
        explaining that death is to be expected as a natural phenomenon in all 
        living beings.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You have suffered 
        from similar situations, not once, Pat√†c√†r√†, but many times during 
        your previous existences. For a long time you suffered due to the deaths 
        of a father, a mother, children or relatives. While you were thus 
        suffering, you indeed shed more tears than there is water in the 
        ocean.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the talk, 
        Pat√†c√†r√† realised the uncertainty of life. Both Pat√†car√† and Kis√† 
        Gotami comprehended suffering and each learned through their tragic 
        experiences. By deeply understanding the First Noble Truth of 
        &quot;suffering&quot;, the other three Noble Truths were also 
        understood. &quot;Whoso monks, comprehends suffering,&quot; said the 
        Buddha, &quot;also comprehends the arising of suffering, the cessation 
        of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering.&quot;</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Five Aggregates</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Death is the dissolution of 
        <i>Khandhas. </i>The <i>Khandhas </i>are the five aggregates of 
        perception, sensation, mental formations, consciousness and corporeality 
        or matter. The first four are mental aggregates or <i>n√†ma</i><b>, </b>forming 
        the unit of consciousness. The fifth, <i>r√πpa </i>is the material or 
        physical aggregate. This psycho-physical combination is convention-ally 
        named an individual, person or ego. Therefore what entities that exist 
        are not individuals as such, but the two primary constituents of mind 
        and matter, which are rare phenomena. We do not see the five aggregates 
        as phenomena but as an entity because of our deluded minds, and our 
        innate desire to treat these as a self in order to pander to our 
        self-importance. We will be able to see things as they truly are if we 
        only have patience and the will to do so. If we turn inwards to the 
        recesses of our own minds and note with just that bare attention, note 
        objectively without projecting an ego in the process, and then cultivate 
        this practice for a sufficient length of time, as laid down by the 
        Buddha in the <i>Sati Patth√†na Sutta, </i>then we will see these five 
        aggregates, not as an entity, but as a series of physical and mental 
        processes. Then we will not mistake the superficial for the real. We 
        will then see that these aggregates arise and disappear in rapid 
        succession, never being the same for two consecutive moments, never 
        static but always in a state of flux, never being<b> </b>but always 
        becoming.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Rebirth</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The four mental aggregates, 
        viz, consciousness and the three other groups of mental factors forming <i>N√†ma 
        </i>or the unit of consciousness, go on uninterruptedly, arising and 
        disappearing as before, but not in the same setting, because that 
        setting is no more. They have to find immediately a fresh physical base 
        as it were, with which to function -- a fresh material layer appropriate 
        and suitable for all the aggregates to function in harmony. Kamma acts 
        as a law and this law operates to re-set the aggregates after death. The 
        result is &quot;re-birth&quot;.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In brief, the combination 
        of the five aggregates is called birth. Existence of these aggregates as 
        a bundle is called life. Dissolution of these things is called death. 
        And recombination of these aggregates is called rebirth. However, it is 
        not easy for an ordinary man to understand how these so called 
        aggregates could recombine. A proper understanding of the nature of 
        elements, mental energies and the law of Kamma and co-operation of 
        cosmic energies is important in this respect.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To some, this is a simple 
        and natural occurrence. To them death means the separation of the five 
        elements and thereafter nothing remains.</font></p>

        transmigration of the soul from one body to another; and to others, it

        Day of Judgment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To Buddhists, however,

        Death can occur in any one of these four ways.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">i. It can be due to the 
          exhaustion of the life span assigned to beings of that particular 
          species. This type of death is called</font><i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
          Ayukkhaya;</font></p>
          </i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ii. It can be due to the 
          exhaustion of the Kammic energy that caused the birth of the deceased.

          </i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iii. It can be due to the 
          simultaneous exhaustion of the above mentioned two causes <i>- 
          Ubhayakkhaya; </i>and</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iv.<b> </b>Lastly, it can 
          be due to external circumstances, viz, accidents, untimely happenings 
          -- working of natural phenomena or due to a Kamma of a previous 
          existence not referred to in (ii).<i> </i>This is called </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Upacchedake.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is an excellent 
        analogy to explain these four types of death. It is the analogy of the 
        of the oil lamp. The light in the oil lamp can be extinguished due to 
        any one of four causes:-</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">i. The wick in the lamp 
          burns up. This is likened to death through the exhaustion of the life 
          span;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ii. The consummation of 
          the oil in the lamp is likened to death through exhaustion of the 
          Kammic energy;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iii. The consummation of 
          the oil in the lamp and the burning off of the wick at the same time 
          -- is likened to death occurring through the combination of causes 
          described in (i) and (ii) occurring simultaneously; and</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iv<b>. </b>The effect of 
          external factors such as the wind blowing out the light -- is likened 
          to death caused through external factors.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, Kamma alone is 
        not the cause of death. There are external contributory causes also. The 
        Buddha's teaching categorically states that Kamma does not explain all 
        happenings in our lives.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Face Facts</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How should one best face 
        this unavoidable occurrence? By being forewarned -- that is, by 
        reflecting that death will, and must come<b> </b>sooner or later. This 
        does not mean that Buddhists should view life with gloom. Death is real, 
        and has to be faced -- and Buddhism is a religion of reason that trains 
        its followers to face facts, however unpleasant they may be. The Founder 
        of the Sikh religion Guru Nanak said, &quot;The world is afraid of 
        death, to me it brings bliss.&quot; It clearly shows that great and 
        noble people are not afraid of death but are prepared to accept it. Many 
        great people have sacrificed their lives for the welfare of others. 
        Their names are recorded in the history of the world in golden letters 
        for posterity.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Death is Inevitable</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is rather paradoxical 
        that although we so often see death taking its toll of lives, we seldom 
        pause to reflect that we too can similarly sooner or later be victims of 
        death. With our strong attachment to life, we are disinclined to carry 
        with us the morbid thought, although a reality, that death is an 
        absolute certainty. We prefer to put off this awful thought behind us as 
        far away as possible -- deluding ourselves that death is a far-away 
        phenomenon, something not to be worried about. We should be courageous 
        enough to face facts. We must be prepared to face stark reality. Death 
        is<b> </b>a factual happening. If we appreciate such eventualities and 
        equip ourselves with the realisation that death is inevitable; even that 
        has to be accepted as a normal occurrence and not as a dreaded event 
        which we should be able to face when it eventually comes, with calmness, 
        courage and confidence.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With the certain knowledge 
        that death will ultimately overtake us one day, we should decide, with 
        the same calmness, courage and confidence, to discharge our duties and 
        responsibilities towards our immediate dependents. We should not 
        procrastinate our responsible duties. We should not leave things for 
        tomorrow when they can be done today. We should make good use of time 
        and spend our lives usefully. Our duties to our wives, husbands and 
        children deserves priority and should be performed in due time. We 
        should execute our last will and testament, without waiting for the last 
        moment, so that we may not cause undue distress, difficulties and 
        problems to our families due to our neglect. Death may call at any time 
        -- it is no respecter of person or time. We should be able to face this 
        ultimate event bravely with hope and confidence if we prepare for the 
        next existence.</font></p>

        answer is - Yes!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Death exists because of 
        birth. This repetition of countless births is called <i>Sams√†ra. </i>If 
        this cycle of existence is to be stopped, it can be cut off only at the 
        stage of <i>Avijj√† </i>(ignorance) and<i> Tanh√† </i>(Craving) -- These 
        are the roots in this cycle of births and have to be exterminated. 
        Therefore, if we cut off Craving and Ignorance -- birth is overcome, 
        death conquered, <i>Sams√†ra</i> is transcended and <i>Nibb√†na</i> 
        attained.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We should try to understand

        sorrow.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Vis√†kh√†, would you 
        like to have as many sons and grandsons as there are children in this 
        town?&quot; asked the Buddha. &quot;Yes, Sir, I would indeed!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then, Vis√†kh√†, in 
        such a case would you cry for all of them when they die? Vis√†kh√†, 
        those who have a hundred things beloved, they have a hundred sorrows. He 
        who has nothing beloved, has no sorrow. Such persons are free from 
        sorrow.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we develop attachment, 
        we also must be prepared to pay the price of sorrow when separation 
        takes place.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The love of life can 
        sometimes develop into a morbid fear of death. We will not take any 
        risks even for a rightful cause. We live in fear that an illness or 
        accident will put an end to our seemingly precious life. Realising that 
        death is a certainty, we hope and pray for the survival of the soul in 
        heaven for our own security and preservation. Such beliefs are based on 
        strong craving for continued existence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Each and every individual 
        should be aware of the role of death in his or her destiny. Whether 
        royalty or commoner, rich or poor, strong or weak, a man's final resting 
        place for his body is either in a coffin lying buried six feet 
        underground or in an urn or in the water.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All human beings face and 
        share the same fate. Due to ignorance of the true nature of life, we 
        often weep and wail. When once we realise the true nature of life, we 
        can face the impermanence of all component things and seek liberation. 
        Until and unless we achieve our liberation from worldly conditions, we 
        will have to face death over and over again. And in this respect, too, 
        the role of death is very clear. If a person finds death to be 
        unbearable, then he should make every endeavour to overcome this cycle 
        of birth and death.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Contemplation on Death</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Why should we think about 
        death? Why should we contemplate it?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Not only did the Buddha 
        encourage us to speak about death, he also encouraged us to contemplate 
        it and reflect on it regularly. That which is born will die. The mind 
        and body which arise at the time of conception develop, grow and mature. 
        In other words, they follow the process of ageing. We call it growing up 
        at first, then growing old, but it is just a single process of maturing, 
        developing, and evolving ultimately towards inevitable death.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Today, according to a world 
        record, about 200,000 people die, on the average, everyday. Apparently 
        about 70 million people die every year.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We are not used to 
        contemplate death or come to terms with it. What we usually do is to 
        avoid it and live as if we were never going to die. As long as there is 
        fear of death, life itself is not being lived to its fullest and at its 
        best. So one of the very fundamental reasons for contemplating death, 
        for making this reality fully conscious, is that of overcoming fear. The 
        contemplation of death is not for making us depressed or morbid; it is 
        rather for the purpose of helping to free ourselves from fear.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second reason is that 
        contemplation of death will change the way we live and our attitudes 
        towards life. The values that we have in life will change quite 
        drastically once we stop living as if we are going to live forever, and 
        we will start living in a quite different way.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The third reason is to 
        develop the ability to approach and face death in the right and peaceful 
        way.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The contemplation of death 
        has three-fold benefits:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* relieving fear;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* bringing a new quality 
          to our lives, enabling us to live our lives with proper values; and</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* enabling us to die in 
          dignity. It enables us to live a good life and die a good death.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What else do we need?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The contemplation on the 
        following factors are encouraged in Buddhism:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* I<i> </i>am of the 
          nature to age, I have not gone beyond ageing;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* I am<i> </i>of the 
          nature to sicken, I have not gone beyond sickness;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* I am subjected to my 
          own kamma and I am not free from kammic effects;</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* I<i> </i>am of the 
          nature to die, I have not gone beyond dying; and</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* All that is mine, 
          beloved and pleasing, will change, will become otherwise, will become 
          separated from me.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we contemplate this 
        reality with a peaceful mind and bring it into consciousness, it has a 
        powerful effect in overcoming the fear of old age, sickness, death and 
        separation. It is not for making us morbid, rather it is for freeing 
        ourselves from fear. That is why we contemplate death: it is not that we 
        are eagerly looking forward to dying, but that we want to live and die 
        without fear.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Death is Part of Life</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Death comes to all and is 
        part of our life cycle. Some die in their prime, others in old age, but 
        all must inevitably die. Uninvited we came into this world and unbidden 
        we leave it. Inevitably I am going to die - so does everybody, every 
        plant, every form, every living being, which follows the same path. Soon 
        it will be autumn, the leaves will fall off the trees. We do not cry, it 
        is natural, that is what the leaves are supposed to do at the end of the 
        season. Human beings experience the same thing. Religious people usually 
        have less fear of death than very materialistic people, because 
        materialists are particularly interested only in this life to satisfy 
        their five-fold senses.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But from the Buddhist 
        perspective, death is not the end and each birth too is not the 
        beginning of a life. In fact death is the beginning of life and 
        conversely birth is the ending of life. It is just one part of a whole 
        process, a whole cyclic process of birth, death, rebirth and dying 
        again. If one has some understanding of this on-going process, death 
        begins to lose its ability to create morbid terror, because it is not so 
        final after all. It is only the end of a cycle; just one cycle along the 
        way and then the way continues ad infinitum with other cycles. The 
        leaves fall off the trees, but it is not the end. They go back to the 
        soil and nourish the roots; next year the tree has new leaves. The same 
        can be said of human life. Conditioned by the moment of death is 
        rebirth. An understanding of this basic principle helps to relieve 
        ourselves of the fear about death.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Living Consciously</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We live our lives in many 
        foolish ways without even considering how much time we waste for 
        nothing. How much time have we wasted today worrying about<b> </b>next 
        year, about the next twenty years, thinking about the future, to the 
        extent that we have not been fully living even this very day?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And our values in life will 
        change. What is important in life? What is motivating us? What is the 
        driving factor in our lives? If we really contemplate death it may cause 
        us to reconsider our values. It does not matter how much money we have 
        for we cannot take any of it with us. Even our own body has to be left 
        behind for others to dispose of in one way or another; it is just a heap 
        of refuse left behind. We cannot take our precious body with us when we 
        leave this world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The quality of life is more 
        important than mere material acquisitions. The quality of life is 
        primarily the quality of our minds. How we are living today may be more 
        important to us than many other external things. But the condition for 
        rebirth, and that of rebirth is conditioned by death and the quality of 
        the mind. This is one thing we take with us.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the one inheritance 
        that we do not leave behind for others:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- I am the owner of my 
          kamma, heir to my kamma.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">- Born of my kamma,

        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All that which will follow 
        us will be the qualities that we develop within us, the qualities of 
        mind, the spiritual qualities and the good or bad qualities. These are 
        all what we inherit.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are the conditions 
        which will determine our rebirth and shape the future. These in turn 
        will give rise to a new value in our lives. We may enjoy the millions we 
        have already gained but it is more important that we live more 
        peacefully and start to build up some virtuous qualities. It can have a 
        very good effect on the way we live our lives and on the values we 
        develop. It is not just a matter of being successful; it is how we 
        become successful.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dying a Good Death</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Having considered all of 
        these, if dying becomes no longer an alarming event but an actual 
        experience, we can with confidence face it. Not only that we can also do 
        a lot towards dying a good death. If we have led a good life, dying is 
        easier. But regardless of how we have lived, we can still endeavour to 
        die a good death. To help in the dying process, we stress very much the 
        development of the same quality of fearlessness. For many people, it's 
        more the fear of pain and the fear of separation from all their loved 
        ones, more than anything else, that is fearsome. At the time of dying, 
        encouragement and reassurance are most essential. For a start you need 
        to reassure yourself. The pain indeed will be excruciating and will be 
        difficult to bear, but we are fortunate in that advances in modern 
        medicines make it possible to reduce the amount of physical pain a human 
        being has to experience before death. Pain need not be such an 
        overwhelming object of fear.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I usually reassure a dying 
        person, such as someone who is terminally ill, for example with cancer, 
        that he will not needlessly be allowed to suffer and, that prompt 
        treatment will be given to alleviate his pain. An important result of 
        this is that the patient can relax and die more peacefully.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The other worry is the 
        inevitable separation from one's possessions. Of course, if we've 
        contemplated this before, it's a lot easier.<b> </b>We know that to come 
        together implies separation. If a dying person hasn't done this kind of 
        contemplation, then you need to gently encourage and reassure him or her 
        that the children and those left behind will be well taken care of. They 
        need to be reassured that it's all right, that there are friends to take 
        care of them; they need to be encouraged to relax and be peaceful, not 
        to worry about other things, that they'll all be taken care of.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The whole emphasis is on 
        trying to encourage the dying person, to become more peaceful.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How can one die a good 
        death? The Buddhist way is to maintain an atmosphere of peace in the 
        room where someone is dying. It's not very conducive to have people 
        shouting, screaming and crying. What does that do to the poor person who 
        has this very important thing to do, to die? They make it very difficult 
        for the dying person to die peacefully. It's good if friends and 
        relatives who are present, show by their presence that they care, that 
        they love, that they are willing to contribute something to support.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Religious symbols are 
        very useful and come in handy in such situations. If the dying person is 
        a Buddhist, then a small Buddha statue, and possibly the presence of 
        Buddhist monks with soothing words of chanting will be very beneficial 
        so as to allow the dying person to pass away with the greatest peace and 
        dignity. It's a wonderful thing for them to move into their new life in 
        the best possible way.&quot; (Ajahn Jagaro)</font></p>

        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone hopes and desires 
        to have a peaceful death after having fulfilled his lifetime duties and 
        obligations. But how many have actually prepared themselves for such an 
        eventuality? How many, for instance, have taken the trouble to fulfil 
        their obligations to their families, loved ones, friends, country, 
        religion and their own destiny? It will be difficult for them to die 
        peacefully if they have not fulfilled any of these obligations. We must 
        learn to overcome the fear of death by realising that the gods are also 
        subjected to it. Those who have allowed fleeting time to pass away 
        frivolously will have good cause to lament later on when they themselves 
        are nearing the end of their lives. When people see their own lives as 
        being only a drop in an ever-flowing river, they will be moved to 
        contribute even their little part to the great stream of life. The wise 
        know that to live they have to work for their liberation by avoiding 
        evil, doing good and purifying their mind. People who understand life 
        according to the Teachings of the Buddha never worry about death. Death 
        is no cause for sorrow, but it would indeed be sorrowful if one dies 
        without having done something for oneself and for the world.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">David Morris was a well 
        known Western Buddhist scholar who died at the age of 85. Soon after his 
        death the writer of this booklet received a letter from him (obviously 
        he had written it earlier with instructions for it to be posted on his 
        death.) It went like this, &quot;You will be happy to know that I died 
        today. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, you will be relieved to 
        know that my suffering from the sickness has finally ended. And 
        secondly, since I became a Buddhist I have faithfully observed the five 
        precepts. As a result you know that my next life cannot be a miserable 
        one&quot;.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Life is like a dream. Death 
        is a factual happening and rebirth a natural occurrence. In preparing 
        for that eventuality one would either have to continue or to end the 
        repeated cycle of births and deaths so as to be free from suffering and 
        this is what human intelligence is all about.</font></p>
