        Why? What?</b></font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> are some 
        important problems that affect all humanity.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Who is man?</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        is our first question.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us proceed with what is 
        self-evident and perceptible to all.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Man possesses a body which 
        is seen either by our senses or by means of apparatus. This material 
        body consists of forces and qualities which are in a state of constant 
        flux.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Scientists find it 
        difficult to define what matter is. Certain philosophers define 
        &quot;matter as that in which proceed the changes called motion, and 
        motion as those changes which proceed in matter.&quot; (Ouspensky -- <i>Tertium 
        Organum</i> p. 8)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Pàli term for matter 
        is <i>Rùpa. </i>It is explained as that which changes or disintegrates. 
        That which manifests itself is also another explanation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism there 
        are four fundamental material elements. They are <i>Pathavi, Àpo, Tejo, 
        </i>and </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Vàyo</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Pathavi</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        means the element of extension, the substratum of matter. Without it 
        objects cannot occupy space. The qualities of hardness and softness 
        which are purely relative are two conditions of this element. This 
        element of extension is present in earth, water, fire and air. For 
        instance, the water above is supported by water below. It is this 
        element of extension in conjunction with the element of motion <i>(Vàyo)</i> 
        that produces the upward pressure. Heat or cold is the <i>Tejo</i> 
        element, while fluidity is the <i>Àpo </i>element.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Àpo </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">is 
        the element of cohesion. Unlike <i>Pathavi </i>it is intangible. It is 
        this element which enables the scattered atoms of matter to cohere and 
        thus gives us the idea of body.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Tejo </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">is 
        the element of heat. Cold is also a form of <i>Tejo.</i> Both heat and 
        cold are included in <i>Tejo </i>because they possess the power of 
        maturing bodies, or, in other words, the vitalizing energy. Preservation 
        and decay are due to this element.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Vàyo </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">is 
        the element of motion. The movements are caused by this element. Motion 
        is regarded as the force or the generator of heat. Both motion and heat 
        in the material realm correspond respectively to consciousness and Kamma 
        in the mental.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These four powerful forces 
        are inseparable and interrelated, but one element may preponderate over 
        another, as, for instance, the element of extension preponderates in 
        earth; cohesion, in water; heat, in fire; and motion, in air.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, matter consists of 
        forces and qualities which constantly change not remaining the same even 
        for two consecutive moments. According to Buddhism matter endures only 
        for 17 thought-moments. (During the time occupied by a flash of 
        lightning billions and billions of thought-moments may arise).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the moment of birth, 
        according to biology, man inherits from his parents an infinitesimally 
        minute cell 30 millionth part of an inch across. &quot;In the course of 
        nine months this speck grows to a living bulk 15,000 million times 
        greater than it was at outset. (Sir Charles Sherrington - <i>Life's 
        Unfolding, </i>p. 32). This tiny chemico-physical cell is the physical 
        foundation of man.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism sex 
        is also determined at the moment of conception.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Combined with matter there 
        is another important factor in this complex machinery of man. It is the 
        mind. As such it pleases some learned writers to say that man is not 
        Mind plus Body, but is a Mind-Body. Scientists declare that life emerges 
        from matter and mind from life. But they do not give us a satisfactory 
        explanation with regard to the development of the mind</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unlike the material body 
        immaterial mind is invisible, but it could be sensed directly. An old 
        couplet runs:-</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What is mind? No 
        matter.<br>
        What is matter? Never mind.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We are aware of our 
        thoughts and feelings and so forth by direct sensation, and we infer 
        their existence in others by analogy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are several Pàli 
        terms for mind. <i>Mana, Citta,</i> <i>Vinnàna<b> </b></i>are the most 
        noteworthy of them. Compare the Pàli root <i>man, </i>to think, with 
        the English word man and the Pàli word <i>Manussa </i>which means he 
        who has a developed consciousness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism no distinction 
        is made between mind and consciousness. Both are used as synonymous 
        terms. Mind may be defined as simply the awareness of an object since 
        there is no agent or a soul that directs all activities. It consists of 
        fleeting mental states which constantly arise and perish with lightning 
        rapidity. &quot;With birth for its source and death for its mouth it 
        persistently flows on like a river receiving from the tributary streams 
        of sense constant accretions to its flood.&quot; Each momentary 
        consciousness of this ever-changing life-stream, on passing away, 
        transmits its whole energy, all the indelibly recorded impressions, to 
        its successor. Every fresh consciousness therefore consists of the 
        potentialities of its predecessors and something more. As all 
        impressions are indelibly recorded in this ever-changing palimpsest-like 
        mind, and as all potentialities are transmitted from life to life, 
        irrespective of temporary physical disintegrations, reminiscence of past 
        births or past incidents becomes a possibility. If memory depends solely 
        on brain cells, it becomes an impossibility.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Like electricity mind is 
        both a constructive and destructive powerful force. It is like a 
        double-edged weapon that can equally be used either for good or evil. 
        One single thought that arises in this invisible mind can even save or 
        destroy the world. One such thought can either populate or depopulate a 
        whole country. It is mind that creates one's heaven. It is mind that 
        creates one's hell.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ouspensky 
        writes:--&quot;Concerning the latent energy contained in the phenomena 
        of consciousness, i.e. in thoughts, feelings, desires, we discover that 
        its potentiality is even more immeasurable, more boundless. From 
        personal experience, from observation, from history, we know that ideas, 
        feelings, desires, manifesting themselves, can liberate enormous 
        quantities of energy, and create infinite series of phenomena. An idea 
        can act for centuries and milleniums and only grow and deepen, evoking 
        ever new series of phenomena, liberating ever fresh energy. We know that 
        thoughts continue to live and act when even the very name of the man who 
        created them has been converted into a myth, like the names of the 
        founders of ancient religions, the creators of the immortal poetical 
        works of antiquity, heroes, leaders, and prophets. Their words are 
        repeated by innumerable lips, their ideas are studied and commented 
        upon.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Undoubtedly each 
        thought of a poet contains enormous potential force, like the power 
        confined in a piece of coal or in a living cell, but infinitely more 
        subtle, imponderable and potent.&quot; (Ouspensky<i> -- Tertium Organum</i> 
        p. 125)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Observe, for instance, the 
        potential force that lies in the following significant words of the 
        Buddha:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-- <i>Mano-pubbangamà 
        dhammà - mano - setthà - manomayà.<br>
        </i>Mind foreruns deeds; mind is chief, and mind-made are they. 
        (Dhammapada)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mind or consciousness, 
        according to Buddhism, arises at the very moment of conception, together 
        with matter. Consciousness is therefore present in<b> </b>the foetus. 
        This initial consciousness, technically known as rebirth-consciousness 
        or relinking-consciousness <i>(Patisandhi vinnàna), </i>is conditioned 
        by past kamma of the person concerned. The subtle mental, intellectual, 
        and moral differences that exist amongst mankind are due to this Kamma 
        conditioned consciousness, the second factor of man.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To complete the trio that 
        constitutes man there is a third factor, the phenomenon of life that 
        vitalizes both mind and matter. Due to the presence of life reproduction 
        becomes possible. Life manifests itself both in physical and mental 
        phenomena. In Pàli the two forms of life are termed <i>Nàma</i> <i>jivitindriya 
        </i>and<i> Rùpa jivitindriya -- </i>psychic<i> </i>and physical life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Matter, mind, and life are 
        therefore the three distinct factors that constitute man. With their 
        combination a powerful force known as man with inconceivable 
        possibilities comes into being. He becomes his own creator and 
        destroyer. In him are found a rubbish-heap of evil and a storehouse of 
        virtue. In him are found the worm, the brute, the man, the superman, the 
        deva, the Brahma. Both criminal tendencies and saintly characteristics 
        are dormant in him. He may either be a blessing or a curse to himself 
        and others. In fact man<b> </b>is a world by himself.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whence? </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">is 
        our second question.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How did man originate'?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Either there must be a 
        beginning for man or there cannot be a beginning. Those who belong to 
        the first school postulate a first cause, whether as a cosmic force or 
        as an<b> </b>Almighty Being. Those who belong to the second school deny 
        a first cause for, in common experience, the cause ever becomes the 
        effect and the effect becomes the cause. In a circle of cause and effect 
        a first cause is inconceivable. According to the former life has had a 
        beginning; while according to the latter it is beginningless. In the 
        opinion of some the conception of a first cause is as ridiculous as a 
        round triangle.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the scientific 
        standpoint, man is the direct product of the sperm and ovum cells 
        provided by his parents. Scientists while asserting <i>&quot;Omne vivum 
        ex vivo&quot;--</i>all life from life, maintain, that mind and life 
        evolved from the lifeless.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, from the scientific 
        standpoint, man is absolutely parent-born. As such life precedes life. 
        With regard to the origin of the first protoplasm of life, or 
        &quot;colloid&quot; (whichever we please to call it), scientists plead 
        ignorance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism man 
        is born from the matrix of action <i>(kammayoni). </i>Parents merely 
        provide man with a material layer. As such being precedes being. At the 
        moment of conception, it is Kamma that conditions the initial 
        consciousness that vitalizes the foetus. It is this invisible Kammic 
        energy generated from the past birth that produces mental phenomena and 
        the phenomenon of life in an already extant physical phenomenon, to 
        complete the trio that constitutes man.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dealing with the conception 
        of beings the Buddha states:--</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Where three are found 
        in combination, there a germ of life is planted. If mother and father 
        come together, but it is not the mother's period, and the 'being-to-be 
        born' <i>(gandhabba)</i> is not present, then no germ of life is 
        planted. If mother and father come together, and it is the mother's 
        period, but the 'being-to-be-born' is not present, then again no<b> </b>germ 
        of life is planted. If mother and father come together, and it is the 
        mother's period, and the 'being-to-bc-born' is also present, then, by 
        the combination of these three, a germ of life is there planted.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Here <i>Gandhabba (= 
        gantabba) </i>refers to a suitable being ready to be born in that 
        particular womb. This term is used only in this particular connection, 
        and must not be mistaken for a permanent soul.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For a being to be born here 
        a being must die somewhere. The birth of a being corresponds to the 
        death of a being in a past life; just as, in conventional terms, the 
        rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the sun in another 
        place.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha states:--&quot;a 
        first beginning of beings who, obstructed by ignorance and fettered by 
        craving, wander and fare on, is not to be perceived.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This life-stream flows <i>ad 
        infinitum </i>as long as it is fed with the muddy waters of ignorance 
        and craving. When these two are completely cut off, then only does the 
        life-stream cease to flow; rebirth ends as in the case of Buddhas and 
        Arahants. An ultimate beginning of this life-stream cannot be 
        determined, as a stage cannot be perceived when this life force was not 
        fraught with ignorance and craving.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha has here 
        referred merely to the beginning of the life-stream of living beings. It 
        is left to scientists to speculate on the origin and the evolution of 
        the universe.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whither? </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">is 
        our third question.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Where goes man?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to ancient 
        materialism which, in Pàli and Samskrit, is known as <i>Lokàyata, </i>man 
        is annihilated after death, leaving behind him any force generated by 
        him. &quot;Man is composed of four elements. When man dies the earthy 
        element returns and relapses into the earth; the watery element returns 
        into the water; the fiery element returns into the fire; the airy 
        element returns into the air, the senses pass into space.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Wise and fools alike, when 
        the body dissolves. are cut off, perish, do not exist any longer. There 
        is no other world. Death is the end of all. This present world alone is 
        real.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The so-called eternal 
        heaven and hell are the inventions of imposters (Sri Radhakrishna -- <i>Indian 
        Philosophy. </i>Vol. 1. p. 278).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Materialists believe only 
        in<b> </b>what is cognizable by the senses. As such matter alone is 
        real. The ultimate principles are the four elements -- earth, water, 
        fire and air. The self conscious life mysteriously springs forth from 
        them, just as the genie makes its appearance when Aladdin rubs his lamp. 
        The brain secretes thought just as liver secretes bile.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the view of materialists 
        the belief in the other world, as Sri Radhakrishna states, &quot;is a 
        sign of mendaciousness, feminism, weakness, cowardice and 
        dishonesty.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Christianity 
        there is no past for man. The present is only a preparation for two 
        eternities of heaven and hell. Whether they are viewed as places or 
        states man has for his future endless felicity in heaven or endless 
        suffering in hell. Man is therefore not annihilated after death, but his 
        essence goes to eternity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whoever,&quot; as 
        Schopenhaeur says, &quot;regards himself as having become out of nothing 
        must also think that he will again become nothing; or that an eternity 
        has passed before he was, and then a second eternity had begun, through 
        which he will never cease to be, is a monstrous thought.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The adherents of Hinduism 
        who believe in a past and present do not state that man is annihilated 
        after death. Nor do they say that man is eternalized after death. They 
        believe in an endless series of past and future births. In their opinion 
        the life-stream of man flows <i>ad infinitum </i>as long as it is 
        propelled by the force of Kamma, one's actions. In due course the 
        essence of man may be reabsorbed into Ultimate Reality<i> (Paramàtma) </i>from 
        which his soul emanated.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism believes in the 
        present. With the present as the basis it argues the past and future. 
        Just as an electric light is the outward manifestation of invisible 
        electric energy even so man is merely the outward manifestation of an 
        invisible energy known as Kamma. The bulb may break, and the light may 
        be extinguished, but the current remains and the light may be reproduced 
        in another bulb. In the same way the Kammic force remains undisturbed by 
        the disintegration of the physical body, and the passing away of the 
        present consciousness leads to the arising of a fresh one in another 
        birth. Here the electric current is like the Kammic force, and the bulb 
        may be compared to the egg-cell provided by the parents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Past Kamma conditions the 
        present birth; and present Kamma, in combination with past Kamma, 
        conditions the future. The present is the offspring of the past, and 
        becomes in turn the parent of the future.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Death is therefore not the 
        complete annihilation of man, for though that particular life span 
        ended, the force which hitherto actuated it is not destroyed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After death the life-flux 
        of man continues <i>ad infinitum </i>as long as it is fed with the 
        waters of ignorance and craving. In conventional terms man need not 
        necessarily be born as a man because humans are not the only living 
        beings. Moreover, earth, an almost insignificant speck in the universe, 
        is not the only place in which he will seek rebirth. He may be born in 
        other habitable planes as well (&quot;There are about 1,000,000

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If man wishes to put and 
        end to this repeated series of births, he can do so as the Buddha and 
        Arahants have done by realizing Nibbàna, the complete cessation of all 
        forms of craving.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Where does man go? He can 
        go wherever he wills or likes if he is fit for it. If, with no 
        particular wish, he leaves his path to be prepared by the course of 
        events, he will go to the place or state he fully deserves in accordance 
        with his Kamma.</font></p>

        our last question.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Why is man? Is there a 
        purpose in life? This is rather a controversial question.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is the materialistic 
        standpoint? Scientists answer:-</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Has life purpose? 
        What, or where, or when?</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"><br>

        Came Earth, came Life, came Man, and more must come.</i><br>
        </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">But as to Purpose: whose or 
        whence? Why, None.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As materialists confine 
        themselves purely to sense-data and the present material welfare 
        ignoring all spiritual values, they hold a view diametrically opposite 
        to that of moralists. In their opinion there is no purposer -- hence 
        there cannot be a purpose. Non-theists, to which category belong 
        Buddhists as well, do not believe in a creative purposer.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Who colours 
        wonderfully the peacocks, or who makes the cuckoos coo so well?&quot; 
        This is one of the chief arguments of the materialists to attribute 
        everything to the natural order of things.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Eat, drink, and be 
        merry, for death comes to all, closing our lives,&quot; appears to be 
        the ethical ideal of their system. In their opinion, as Sri Radhakrishna 
        writes:-- Virtue is a delusion and enjoyment is the only reality. Death 
        is the end of life. Religion is a foolish aberration, a mental disease. 
        There was a distrust of everything good, high, pure, and compassionate. 
        The theory stands for sensualism and selfishness and the gross 
        affirmation of the loud will. There is no need to control passion and 
        instinct, since they are nature's legacy to men.&quot; (<i>Indian 
        Philosophy</i> Vol. I, p. 201).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sarvadarsana Sangraha

        live joyously,<br>
        None can escape Death's searching eye;<br>
        When once this frame of ours they burn,<br>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;While life remains 
        let a man live happily, let him feed on ghee even though he runs in 
        debt.&quot;<br>
        Now let us turn towards science to get a solution to the question 
        &quot;why.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be noted that 
        &quot;science is a study of things, a study of what is and that religion 
        is a study of ideals, a study of what should be.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sir J. Arthur Thompson 
        maintains that science is incomplete because it cannot answer the 
        question why.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dealing with cosmic 
        Purpose, Bertrand Russell states three kinds of views -- theistic, 
        pantheistic, and emergent. &quot;The first&quot;, he writes, &quot;holds 
        that God created the world and decreed the laws of nature because he 
        foresaw that in time some good would be evolved. In this view purpose 
        exists consciously in the mind of the Creator, who remains external to 
        His creation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the 'pantheistic' 
        form, God is not external to the universe, but is merely the universe 
        considered as a whole. There cannot therefore be an act of creation, but 
        there is a kind of creative force in the universe, which causes it to 
        develop according to a plan which this creative force may be said to 
        have had in mind throughout the process.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the 'emergent' 
        form the purpose is more blind. At an earlier stage, nothing in the 
        universe foresees a later stage, but a kind of blind impulsion leads to 
        those changes which bring more developed forms into existence, so that, 
        in some rather obscure sense, the end is implicit in the 
        beginning.&quot; (Bertrand Russell, <i>Religion and Science. </i>p. 
        191.)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We offer<b> </b>no 
        comments. These are merely the views of different religionists and great 
        thinkers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whether there is a cosmic 
        purpose or not a question arises as to the usefulness of the tapeworm, 
        snakes, mosquitoes and so forth, and for the existence of rabies. How 
        does one account for the problem of evil? Are earthquakes, floods, 
        pestilences, and wars designed?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Expressing his own view 
        about Cosmic Purpose, Russell boldly declares:--&quot;Why in any case, 
        this glorification of man? How about lions and tigers? They destroy 
        fewer animals or human lives than we do, and they are much more 
        beautiful than we are. How about ants? They manage the Corporate State 
        much better than any Fascist. Would not a world of nightingales and 
        larks and deer be better than our human world of cruelty and injustice 
        and war?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The believers in cosmic 
        purpose make much of our supposed <b>in</b>telligence, but their 
        writings make one doubt it. If I were granted omnipotence, and millions 
        of years to experiment in, I should not think Man much to boast of as 
        the final result of all my efforts.&quot; (Bertrand Russel,<i> Religion 
        and Science, </i>p.221)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is the purpose of life 
        according to different religions?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Hinduism the 
        purpose of life is &quot;to be one with Brahma&quot; or &quot;to be 
        re-absorbed in the Divine Essence from which his soul emanated.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Judaism, 
        Christianity and Islam, it is &quot;to glorify God and to enjoy Him for 
        ever.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Will an average person of 
        any religion be prepared to give up his earthly life, to which he 
        tenaciously clings, for immortality in their ultimate havens of peace?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Very doubtful, indeed!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, how does Buddhism 
        answer the question &quot;why?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism denies the 
        existence of a Creator. As such from a Buddhist standpoint there cannot 
        be a fore-ordained purpose. Nor does Buddhism advocate fatalism, 
        determinism, or pre-destination which controls man's future independent 
        of his free actions. In such a case freewill becomes an absolute farce 
        and<b> </b>life becomes purely mechanistic.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To a large extent man's 
        actions are more or less mechanistic, being influenced by his own 
        doings, upbringing, environment and so forth. But to a certain extent 
        man can exercise his freewill. A person, for instance, falling from a 
        cliff will be attracted to the ground just as an inanimate stone would. 
        In this case he cannot use his freewill although he has a mind unlike 
        the stone. If he were to climb a cliff, he could certainly use his 
        freewill and act as he likes. A stone, on the contrary, is not free to 
        do so of its own accord. Man has the power to choose between right and 
        wrong, good and bad. Man can either be hostile or friendly to himself 
        and<b> </b>others. It all depends on his mind and its development.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although there is no 
        specific purpose in man's existence, yet man <b>is </b>free to have some 
        purpose in life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What, therefore, is the 
        purpose of life?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ouspensky 
        writes:--&quot;Some say that the meaning of life is in service, in the 
        surrender of self, in self-sacrifice, in the sacrifice of everything, 
        even life itself. Others declare that the meaning of life is in the 
        delight of it, relieved against 'the expectation of the final horror of 
        death.' Some say that the meaning of life is in perfection, and the 
        creation of a better future beyond the grave, or in<b> </b>future life 
        for ourselves. Others say that the meaning of life is in the approach to 
        non-existence; still others, that the meaning of life is in the 
        perfection of the race, in the organization of life on earth; while 
        there are those who deny the possibility of even attempting to know its 
        meaning.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Criticising all these views 
        the learned writer says:--&quot;The fault of all these explanations 
        consists in the fact that they all attempt to discover the meaning of 
        life outside of itself, either in the nature of humanity, or in some 
        problematical existence beyond the grave, or again in the evolution of 
        the Ego throughout many successive incarnations -- always in something 
        outside of the present life of man. But if instead of thus speculating 
        about it, men would simply look within themselves, then they would see 
        that in reality the meaning of life is not after all so obscure. It 
        consists in<b> </b>knowledge.&quot; (<i>Tertium Organum</i>, p. 192.)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the opinion of a 
        Buddhist, the purpose of life is Supreme Enlightenment <i>(Sambodhi), </i>i.e.<i> 
        </i>understanding of oneself as one really is. This may be achieved 
        through sublime conduct, mental culture, and penetrative insight; or in<b> 
        </b>other words, through service and perfection.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In service are included 
        boundless loving-kindness, compassion, and absolute selflessness which 
        prompt man to be of service to others. Perfection embraces absolute 
        purity and absolute wisdom.</font></p>
