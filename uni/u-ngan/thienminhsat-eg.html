        practice of <I>Vipassana</I> or insight Meditation is the effort made by 
        the meditator to understand correctly the nature of the psycho-physical 
        phenomena taking place in his own body. Physical phenomena are the 
        things or objects which one clearly perceives around one. The whole of 
        one&#39;s body that one clearly perceives constitutes a group of material 
        qualities <I>(rupa)</I>. Psychical or mental phenomena are acts of 
        consciousness or awareness <I>(nama)</I>. These <I>(nama-rupas)</I> are 
        clearly perceived to be happening whenever they are seen, heard, smell, 
        tasted, touched, or thought of. We must make ourselves aware of them by 
        observing them and noting, thus: <I>&quot;Seeing, seeing&quot;, &quot;hearing, 
        hearing&quot;,&quot;smelling, smelling&quot;, &quot;tasting, tasting&quot;, &quot;touching, touching&quot;,
        </I>or</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> &quot;thinking, thinking.&quot;</FONT></P>
        </I>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Every time one sees, hears, smells, 
        tastes, touches, or thinks, one should make a note of the fact. But in 
        the beginning of one’s practice, one cannot make a note of every one of 
        these happenings. One should therefore, begin with noting those 
        happenings which are conspicuous and easily perceivable.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With every act of breathing, the abdomen 
        rises and falls, which movement is always evident. This is the material 
        quality known as <I>vayodhatu </I>(the element of motion). One should 
        begin by noting this movement, which may be done by the mind intently 
        observing the abdomen. You will find the abdomen rising when you breathe 
        in, and falling when you breathe out. The rising should be noted 
        mentally as <I>&quot;rising&quot;,</I> and the falling as <I>&quot;falling&quot;.</I> If the 
        movement is not evident by just noting it mentally, keep touching the 
        abdomen with the palm of your hand. Do not alter the manner of your 
        breathing. Neither slow it down, nor make it faster. Do not breathe too 
        vigorously, either. You will tire if you change the manner of your 
        breathing. Breathe steadily as usual and note the rising and falling of 
        the abdomen as they occur. Note it mentally, not verbally.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In<I> vipassana </I>meditation, what you 
        name or say doesn&#39;t matter. What really matters is to know or perceive. 
        While noting the rising of the abdomen, do so from the beginning to 
        the-end of the movement just as if you are seeing it with your eyes.- Do 
        the same with the falling movement. Note the rising movement in such a 
        way that your awareness of it is concurrent with the movement itself. 
        The movement and the mental awareness of it should coincide in the same 
        way as a stone thrown hits the target. Similarly with the falling 
        movement.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Your mind may wander elsewhere while you 
        are noting the abdominal movement. This must also be noted by mentally 
        saying <I>&quot;wandering, wandering.&quot; </I>When this has been noted once or 
        twice, the mind stops wandering, in which case you go back to noting the 
        rising and falling of the abdomen. If the mind reaches somewhere, note 
        as <I>&quot;reaching, reaching.&quot;</I> Then go back to the rising and falling 
        of the abdomen. If you imagine meeting somebody, note as <I>&quot;meeting, 
        meeting.&quot;</I> Then back to the rising and falling. If you imagine 
        meeting and talking to somebody, note as </FONT><I>
        <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;talking, talking.&quot;</FONT></P>
        </I>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In short whatever thought or reflection 
        occurs should be noted. If you imagine, note as <I>&quot;imagining&quot;</I>. If 
        you think, <I>&quot;thinking&quot;.</I> If you plan, <I>&quot;planning&quot;.</I> If you 
        perceive, <I>&quot;perceiving&quot;</I>. If you reflect, <I>&quot;reflecting&quot;.</I> If 
        you feel happy, <I>&quot;happy&quot;</I>. If you feel bored, <I>&quot;bored&quot;.</I> If 
        you feel glad, <I>&quot;glad&quot;.</I> If you feel disheartened, <I>
        &quot;disheartened&quot;.</I> Noting all these acts of consciousness is called
        </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">cittanupassana.</FONT></P>
        </I>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Because we fail to note these acts of 
        consciousness, we tend to identify them with a person or individual. We 
        tend to think that it is &quot;I&quot; who is imagining, thinking, planning, 
        knowing (or perceiving). We think that there is a person who from 
        childhood onwards has been living and thinking. Actually, no such person 
        exists. There are instead only these continuing and successive acts of 
        consciousness. That is why we have to note these acts of consciousness 
        and know them for what they are. That is why we have to note each and 
        every act of consciousness as it arises. When so noted, it tends to 
        disappear. We then go back to noting the rising and falling of the 
        abdomen.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you have sat meditating for long, 
        sensations of stiffness and heat will arise in your body. These are to 
        be noted carefully too. Similarly with sensations of pain and tiredness. 
        All of these sensations arc <I>dukkhavedana </I>(feeling of 
        unsatisfactoriness) and noting them is <I>vedenanupassana. </I>Failure 
        or omission to note these sensations makes you think, &quot;I am stiff, I am 
        feeling hot, I am in pain. I was all right a moment ago. Now I am uneasy 
        with these unpleasant sensations.&quot; The identification of these 
        sensations with the ego is mistaken. There is really no &quot;I&quot; involved, 
        only a succession of one new unpleasant sensation after another.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is just like a continuous succession 
        of new electrical impulses that light up electric lamps. Every time 
        unpleasant contacts are encountered in the body, unpleasant sensations 
        arise one after another. These sensations should be carefully and 
        intently noted, whether they are sensations of stiffness, of heat or of 
        pain. In the beginning of the yogi’s meditational practice, these 
        sensations may tend to increase and lead to a desire to change his 
        posture. This desire should be noted, after which the yogi should go 
        back to noting the sensations of stiffness, heat, etc.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Patience leads to Nibbana,&quot; as the 
        saying goes. This saying is most relevant in meditational effort. One 
        must be patient in meditation. If one shifts or changes one&#39;s posture 
        too often because one cannot be patient with the sensation of stiffness 
        or heat that arises, <I>samadhi </I>(good concentration) cannot develop. 
        If<I> samadhi </I>cannot develop, insight cannot result and there can be 
        no attainment of <I>magga </I>(the path that leads to Nibbana), <I>phala
        </I>(the fruit of that path) and <I>Nibbana. </I>That is why patience is 
        needed in meditation. It is patience mostly with unpleasant sensations 
        in the body like stiffness, sensations of heat and pain, and other 
        sensations that are hard to bear. One should not immediately give up 
        one&#39;s meditation on the appearance of such sensations and change one’s 
        meditational posture. One should go on patiently, just noting as <I>
        &quot;stiffness, stiffness&quot;</I> or <I>&quot;hot, hot&quot;</I>. Moderate sensations of 
        these kinds will disappear if one goes on noting them patiently. When 
        concentration is good and strong, even intense sensations tend to 
        disappear. One then reverts to noting the rising and</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">falling of the abdomen.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One will of course have to change one&#39;s 
        posture if the sensations do not disappear even after one has noted them 
        for a long time, and if on the other hand they become unbearable. One 
        should then begin noting as <I>&quot;wishing to change, wishing to change.&quot;</I> 
        If the arm rises, note as <I>&quot;rising, rising.&quot;</I> If it moves, note as
        <I>&quot;moving, moving&quot;.</I> This change should be made gently and noted as
        <I>&quot;rising, rising,&quot; &quot;moving, moving&quot; </I>and</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> 
        &quot;touching, touching.&quot;</FONT></P>
        </I>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If the body sways, <I>&quot;swaying, 
        swaying.&quot;</I> If the foot rises, <I>&quot;rising, rising&quot;</I>. If it moves,
        <I>&quot;moving, moving.&quot;</I> If it drops, <I>&quot;dropping, dropping.&quot;</I> If 
        there is no change, but only static rest, go back to noting the rising 
        and falling of the abdomen. There must be no intermission in between, 
        only contiguity between a preceding act of noting and a succeeding one, 
        between a preceding <I>samadhi</I> (state of concentration) and a 
        succeeding one. Only then will there be successive and ascending stages 
        of maturity in the yogi&#39;s</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">state of intelligence. <I>Magga </I>and
        <I>phala-nyana</I> (knowledge of the path and its fruition) are attained 
        only when there is this kind of gathering momentum. The meditative 
        process is like that of producing fire by energetically and 
        unremittingly rubbing two sticks of wood together so as to attain the 
        necessary intensity of heat (when the flame arises).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the same way the noting in <I>
        vipassana </I>meditation should be continual and unremitting, without 
        any resting interval between acts of noting whatever phenomena may 
        arise. For instance. if, a sensation of itchiness intervenes and the 
        yogi desires to scratch because it is hard to bear. both the sensation 
        and the desire to get rid of it should be noted, without immediately 
        getting rid of the sensation by scratching. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If one goes on perseveringly noting 
        thus, the itchiness generally disappears, in which case one reverts to 
        noting the rising, and falling of the abdomen. If the ichiness does not 
        in fact disappear, one has of course to eliminate it by scratching. But 
        first, the desire to do so should be noted. All the movements involved 
        in the process of eliminating this sensation should be noted, especially 
        the touching, pulling and pushing, and scratching movements, with an 
        eventual reversion to noting the rising and falling of the abdomen.
        </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Every time you make a change of posture, 
        you begin with noting your intention or desire to make the change, and 
        go on to noting every movement closely, such as rising from the sitting 
        posture, raising the arm, moving and stretching it. You should make the 
        change at the same time as noting the movements involved. As your body 
        sways forward, note it. As you rise, the body becomes light and rises. 
        Concentrating your mind on this, you should gently note as </FONT><I>
        <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;rising, rising.&quot; </FONT></P>
        </I>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The yogi should behave as if he were a 
        weak invalid. People in normal health rise easily and quickly or 
        abruptly. Not so with feeble invalids, who do so slowly and gently. The 
        same is the case with people suffering from &quot;back-ache&quot; who rise gently 
        lest the back hurt and cause pain.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So also with meditating yogis. They have 
        to take their changes of posture gradually and gently; only then will 
        mindfulness, concentration and insight be good. Begin therefore with 
        gentle and gradual movements. When rising, the yogi must do so gently 
        like an invalid, at the same time noting as <I>&quot;rising&quot;.</I> Not only 
        this, though the eye sees, the yogi must act as if he does not see. 
        Similarly when the ear hears. While meditating, the yogi&#39;s concern is 
        only to note. What he sees and hears are not his concern. So whatever 
        strange or striking things he may see or hear, he must behave as if he 
        does not see or hear them, merely noting carefully.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When making bodily movements, the yogi 
        should do so gradually as if he were a weak invalid, gently moving the 
        arms and legs, bending or stretching them, bending down the head and 
        bringing it up. All these movements should be made gently. When rising 
        from the sitting posture, he should do so gradually, noting as <I>
        &quot;rising, rising.&quot;</I> When straightening up and standing, note as <I>
        &quot;standing, standing.&quot;</I> When looking here and there, note as <I>
        &quot;looking, seeing.&quot; </I>When walking, note the steps, whether they are 
        taken with the right or the left foot. You must be aware of all the 
        successive movements involved, from -the raising of the foot to the 
        dropping of it. Note each step taken, whether with the right foot or the 
        left foot. This is the manner of noting when one walks fast. It will be 
        enough if you note thus when walking fast and walking some distance. 
        When walking slowly or doing the <I>cankama</I> walk (walking up and 
        down), three movements should be noted in each step: when the foot is 
        raised, when it is pushed forward, and when it is dropped. Begin with 
        noting the raising and dropping movements.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One must be properly aware of the 
        raising of the foot. Similarly: when the foot is dropped, one should be 
        properly aware of the <I>&quot;heavy&quot;</I> falling of the foot.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One must walk, noting as <I>&quot;raising, 
        dropping&quot; </I>with each step. This noting will bccome easier after about 
        two days. Then go on to noting the three movements as described above, 
        as <I>&quot;raising, pushing forward, dropping&quot;.</I> In the beginning, it 
        will suffice to note one or two movements only thus <I>&quot;right step, left 
        step&quot;</I> when walking fast and <I>&quot;raising, dropping&quot;</I>, when walking 
        slowly. If when walking thus, you want to sit down, note as <I>&quot;wanting 
        to sit down, wanting to sit down.&quot; </I>When actually sitting down, note 
        concentratedly the <I>&quot;heavy&quot;</I> falling of your body.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you are seated, note the movements 
        involved in arranging your legs and arms. When there are no such 
        movements but just a stillness (static rest) of the body, note the 
        rising and falling of the abdomen. While noting thus and if stiffness of 
        your limbs and sensation of heat in any part of your body arise, go on 
        to note them. Then back to <I>&quot;rising, falling&quot;.</I> While noting thus 
        and if a desire to lie down arises, note it and the movements of your 
        legs and arms as you lie down. The raising of the arm, the moving of it, 
        the resting of the elbow on the floor, the swaying of the body, the 
        stretching of the legs, the listing of the body as one slowly prepares 
        to lie down, all these movements should be noted. To note as you lie 
        down thus is important. In the course of this movement (that is lying 
        down), you can gain a distinctive knowledge (that is <I>magga-nyana</I> 
        and <I>phala-nyana</I> -- the knowledge of the path and its fruition). 
        When <I>samadhi </I>(concentration) and <I>nyana</I> (insight) are 
        strong, the distinctive knowledge can come at any moment. It can come in 
        a single &quot;bend&quot; of the arm or in a single &quot;stretch&quot; of the arm. Thus it 
        was that the Venerable <I>Ananda </I>became an arahat.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Venerable <I>Ananda </I>was trying 
        strenuously to attain Arahatship overnight on the eve of the first 
        Buddhist Council. He was practicing the whole night the form of <I>
        vipassana</I> meditation known as <I>kayagatasati, </I>noting his steps, 
        right and left, raising, pushing forward and dropping of the feet; 
        noting happening by happening, the mental desire to walk and the 
        physical movement involved in walking. Although this went on till it was 
        nearly dawn, he had not yet succeeded in attaining Arahatship. Realizing 
        that he had practiced the walking meditation to excess and that, in 
        order to balance <I>samadhi </I>(concentration) and <I>viriya </I>
        (effort), he should practice meditation in the lying posture for a 
        while, he entered his chamber. He sat on the couch and then lay himself 
        down. While doing so and noting <I>&quot;lying. lying,&quot;</I> he attained 
        Arahatship in an instant. -</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Venerable Ananda was only a <I>
        sotapanna</I> (that is a stream-winner or one who has attained the first 
        stage on the path to Nibbana) before he thus lay himself down. From <I>
        sotapannahood, </I>he continued to meditate and reached <I>
        sakadagamihood </I>(that is, the condition of the once-returner or one 
        who has attained the second stage on the path), <I>anagamihood </I>(that 
        is, the state of the non-returner or one who has attained the third 
        stage on the path) and <I>arahatship </I>(that is, the condition of the 
        noble one who has attained the last stage on the path). Reaching these 
        three successive stages of the higher path took only a little while. 
        Just think of this example of the Vennerable Ananda&#39;s attainment of 
        arahatship. Such attainment can come at any moment and need not take 
        long.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That is why the yogi should note with 
        diligence all the time. He should not relax in his noting, thinking 
        &quot;this little lapse should not matter much.&quot; All movements involved in 
        lying down and arranging the arms and legs should be carefully and 
        unremittingly noted. If there is no movement, but only stillness (of the 
        body), go back to noting the rising and falling of the abdomen. Even 
        when it is getting late and time for sleep, the yogi should not go to 
        sleep yet, dropping his noting. A really serious and energetic yogi 
        should practice mindfulness as if he were forgoing his sleep altogether. 
        He should go on meditating till he falls asleep. If the meditation is 
        good and has the upper hand, he will not fall asleep. If, on the other 
        hand, drowsiness has the upper hand, he will fall asleep. When he feels 
        sleepy, he should -note as <I>&quot;sleepy, sleepy&quot;</I> if his eyelids droop,
        <I>&quot;drooping&quot;</I>; if they become heavy or leaden, <I>&quot;heavy&quot;</I>; if 
        the eyes become smarting, <I>&quot;smarting&quot;</I>. Noting thus, the drowsiness 
        may pass and the eyes become &quot;clear&quot; again. The yogi should then note as
        <I>&quot;clear, clear&quot;</I> and go on to note the rising and falling of the 
        abdomen. However perseveringly the yogi may go -on meditating, if real 
        drowsiness intervenes, he does fall asleep. It is not difficult to fall 
        asleep; in fact, it is easy. If you meditate in the lying posture, you 
        gradually become drowsy and eventually fall asleep. That is why the 
        beginner in meditation should not meditate too much in the lying 
        posture. He should meditate much more in the sitting and walking 
        postures of the body. But as it grows late and becomes time for sleep, 
        he should meditate in the lying position, noting the rising and falling 
        movements of the abdomen. He will then naturally (automatically) fall 
        asleep.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The time he is asleep is the resting 
        time for the yogi. But for the really serious yogi, he should limit his 
        sleeping time to about four hours. This is the &quot;midnight time&quot; permitted 
        by the Buddha. Four hours’ sleep is quite enough. If the beginner in 
        meditation thinks that four hours’ sleep is not enough for health, he 
        may extend it to five or six hours. Six hours’ sleep is clearly enough 
        for health.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the yogi awakens, he should at once 
        resume noting. The -yogi who is really bent on attaining <I>magga </I>
        and<I> phala nyana</I> should rest from meditational effort only when he 
        is asleep. At other times, in his waking moments, he should be noting 
        continually and without rest. That is why, as soon as he awakens, he 
        should note the awakening state of his mind as <I>&quot;awakening, 
        awakening.&quot;</I> If he cannot yet make himself aware of this, he should 
        begin noting the rising and falling of the abdomen.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If he intends to get up from bed, he 
        should note as <I>&quot;intending to get up, intending to get up.&quot;</I> He 
        should then go on to note the changing movements he makes as he arranges 
        his arms and legs. When he raises his head and rises, note as <I>
        &quot;rising, rising&quot;</I>. When he is seated, note as <I>&quot;sitting, sitting.&quot;</I> 
        If he makes any changing movements as he arranges his arms and legs, all 
        of these movements should also be noted. If there are no such changes, 
        but only a sitting quietly, he should revert to noting the rising and 
        falling movements of the abdomen.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One should also note when one washes 
        one&#39;s face and when one takes a bath. As the movements involved in these 
        acts are rather quick, as many of them should be noted as possible. 
        There are then acts of dressing, of tidying up the bed, of opening and 
        closing the door; all these should also be noted as closely as possible.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the yogi has his meal and looks at 
        the meal-table, he should note as <I>&quot;looking, seeing, looking, seeing.&quot;
        </I>When he extends his arm towards the food, touches it, collects and 
        arranges it, handles it and brings it to the mouth, bends his head and 
        puts the morsel of food into his mouth, drops his arm and raises his 
        head again, all these movements should be duly noted [1].</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When he chews the food, he should note- 
        as <I>&quot;chewing, chewing.&quot;</I> When he comes to know the taste of the 
        food, he should note as &quot;<I>knowing, knowing.&quot;</I> As he relishes the 
        food and swallows it, as the food goes down his throat, he should note 
        all these happenings. This is how the yogi should note as he takes one 
        morsel after another of his food. As he takes his soup, all the 
        movements involved such as extending of the arm, handling of the spoon 
        and scooping with it and so on, all these should be noted. To note thus 
        at meal-time is rather difficult as there are so many things to observe 
        and note. The beginning yogi is likely to miss several things which he 
        should note but he should resolve to note all. He cannot of course help 
        it if he overlooks and misscs some, but as his <I>samadhi </I>
        (concentration) becomes strong, he will be able to note closely all 
        these happenings.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Well, I have mentioned so many things 
        for the yogi to note. But to summarize, there are only a few things to 
        note. When walking fast, note as <I>&quot;right step,&quot; &quot;left step,&quot;</I> and 
        as <I>&quot;raising, dropping&quot;</I> when walking slowly. When sitting quietly, 
        just note the rising and falling of the abdomen. Note the same when you 
        are lying, if there is nothing particular to note. While noting thus and 
        if the mind wanders, note the acts of consciousness that arise. Then 
        back to the rising and falling of the abdomen. Note also the sensations 
        of stiffness, pain, ache, and itchiness as they arise. Then back to the 
        rising and falling of the abdomen. Note also, as they arise, the bending 
        and stretching and moving of the limbs, bending and raising of the head, 
        swaying and straightening of the body. Then back to the rising and 
        falling of the abdomen.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As the yogi goes on noting thus, he will 
        be able to note more and more of these happenings. In the beginning, as 
        his mind wanders here and there, the yogi may miss noting many things. 
        But he should not be disheartened. Every beginner in meditation 
        encounters the same difficulty, but as he becomes more practised he 
        becomes aware of every act of mind-wandering till eventually the mind 
        does not wander any more. The mind is then riveted on the object of its 
        attention, the act of mindfulness becoming almost simultaneous with the 
        object of its attention such as the rising and falling of the abdomen 
        [2]. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The physical object of attention and the 
        mental act of noting are occurring as a pair. There is in this 
        occurrence no person or individual involved, only this physical object 
        of attention and the mental act of noting occurring as a pair. The yogi 
        will in time actually and personally experience these occurrences. While 
        noting the rising and falling of the abdomen he will come to distinguish 
        the rising of the abdomen as physical phenomenon and the mental act of 
        noting of it as psychical phenomenon; similarly with the falling of the 
        abdomen. Thus the yogi will distinctly come to realize the simultaneous 
        occurrence in pair of these psycho-physical phenomena.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus, with every act of noting, the yogi 
        will come to know for himself clearly that there are only this material 
        quality which is the object of awareness or attention and the mental 
        quality that makes a note of it. This discriminating knowledge is called
        <I>namarupa-pariccheda-nyana, </I>the beginning of the <I>
        vipassana-nyana. </I>It is important to gain this knowledge correctly. 
        This will be succeeded, as the yogi goes on, by the knowledge that 
        distinguishes between the cause and its effect, which knowledge is 
        called </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">paccaya-pariggaha-nyana.</FONT></P>
        </I>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As the yogi goes on noting he will see 
        for himself that what arises passes away after a short while. Ordinary 
        people assume that both the material and mental phenomena go on lasting 
        throughout life, that is, from youth to adulthood. In fact, that is not 
        so. There is no phenomenon that lasts for ever. All phenomena arise and 
        pass away so rapidly that they do not last even for the twinkling of an 
        eye. The yogi will come to know this for himself as he goes on noting. 
        He will then become convinced of the impermanency of all such phenomena. 
        Such conviction is called </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
        aniccanupassana-nyana.</FONT></P>
        </I>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#39;I&#39;his knowledge will be succeeded by <I>
        dukkha-nupassana-nyana, </I>which realizes that all this impermanency is 
        suffering. The yogi is also likely to encounter all kinds of hardship in 
        his body, which is just an aggregate of sufferings. This is also <I>
        dukkhanupassana-nyana. </I>Next, the yogi will become convinced that all 
        these psycho-physical phenomena are occurring of their own accord, 
        following nobody&#39;s will and subject to nobody&#39;s control. They constitute 
        no individual or ego-entity. This realization is </FONT><I>
        <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">anattanupassana-nyana.</FONT></P>
        </I>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When, as he goes on meditating, the yogi 
        comes to realize firmly that all these phenomena are <I>anicca, dukkha,
        </I>and<I> anatta,</I> he will attain Nibbana. All the former Buddhas, 
        Arahats and Aryas realized Nibbana following this very path. All 
        meditating yogis should recognize that they them-selves are now on this
        <I>sati-patthana </I>path, in fulfilment of their wish for attainment of
        <I>magga-nana</I> (knowledge of the path), <I>phala-nyana</I> (knowledge 
        of the fruition of the path) and <I>Nibbana-dhamma, </I>and following 
        the ripening of their <I>parami </I>(perfection of virtue). They should 
        feel glad at this and at the prospect of experiencing the noble kind of
        <I>samadhi</I> (tranquillity of mind brought about by concentration) and
        <I>nyana</I> (supramundane knowledge or wisdom) experienced by the 
        Buddhas, Arahats and Aryas and which they themselves have never 
        experienced before.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It will not be long before they will 
        experience for themselves the <I>magga-nyana, phala-nyana</I> and<I> 
        Nibbana-dhamma</I> experienced by the Buddhas, Arahats and Aryas. At a 
        matter of fact, these may be experienced in the space of a month or of 
        twenty or fifteen days of their meditational practice. Thosc whose <I>
        parami </I>is exceptional may experience these <I>dhammas </I>even 
        within seven days.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The yogi should therefore rest content 
        in the faith that he will attain these <I>dhammas</I> in the time 
        specified above, that he will be freed of <I>sakkaya-ditthi </I>
        (ego-belief) and <I>vicikiccha </I>(doubt or uncertainty) and saved from 
        the danger of rebirth in the nether worlds. Hc should go on with his 
        meditational practice in this faith.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">May you all be able to practice 
        meditation well and quickly attain that <I>Nibbana</I> which the 
        lluddhas, Arahats and Aryas have expcienccd!</FONT></P>
