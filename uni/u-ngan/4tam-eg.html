        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">M</font>an 
        is a mysterious being with inconceivable potentialities. Latent in him 
        are both saintly characteristics and criminal tendencies. They may rise 
        to the surface at unexpected moments in disconcerting strength. How they 
        originated we know not. We only know that they are dormant in man in 
        varying degree.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Within the powerful mind in 
        this complex machinery of man are also found a storehouse of virtue and 
        a rubbish heap of evil. With the development of the respective 
        characteristics man may become either a blessing or a curse to humanity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who wish to be great, 
        noble and serviceable, who wish to sublimate themselves and, serve 
        humanity both by example and by precept, and who wish to avail 
        themselves of this golden opportunity as human beings, endeavour their 
        best to remove the latent vices and to cultivate the dormant virtues.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To dig up precious gems 
        embedded in the earth men spend enormous sums of money and make 
        laborious efforts, and sometimes even sacrifice their lives. But to dig 
        up the valuable treasures latent in man, only persistent effort and 
        enduring patience are necessary. Even the poorest man or woman can 
        accomplish this task, for wealth is not an essential prerequisite to the 
        accumulation of transcendental treasures.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is strange that the 
        vices latent in man seem to be almost natural and spontaneous. It is 
        equally strange that every vice possesses its opposite sterling virtue, 
        which does not however appear to be so normal and automatic, though 
        still within the range of all.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One powerful destructive 
        vice in man is anger <i>(dosa). </i>The sweet virtue that subdues this 
        evil force and sublimes man is loving-kindness </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(mettà).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Cruelty <i>(himsà) </i>is 
        another vice that is responsible for many horrors and atrocities 
        prevalent in the world. Compassion <i>(karunà) </i>is its antidote.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Jealousy <i>(issà) </i>is 
        another vice that poisons one's system and leads to unhealthy rivalries 
        and dangerous competitions. The most effective remedy for this poisonous 
        drug is appreciative joy</font><i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        (mudità).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are two other 
        universal characteristics that upset the mental equipoise of man. They 
        are attachment to the pleasurable and aversion to the non-pleasurable. 
        These two opposite forces can be eliminated by developing equanimity </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(upekkhà).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These four sterling virtues 
        are collectively termed in Pàli <i>&quot;Brahmavihàra&quot;</i> which 
        may be rendered by Modes of Sublime Conduct, Sublime States, or Divine 
        Abodes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These virtues tend to 
        elevate man. They make one divine in this life itself. They can 
        transform man into a superman. If all try to cultivate them, 
        irrespective of creed, colour, race, or sex, the earth can be 
        transformed into a paradise where all can live in perfect peace and 
        harmony as ideal citizens of one world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The four sublime virtues 
        are also termed illimitables <i>(appamannà). </i>They are so called 
        because they find no barrier or limit and should be extended towards all 
        beings without exception. They embrace all living beings including 
        animals.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Irrespective of religious 
        beliefs, one can cultivate these sweet virtues and be a blessing to 
        oneself and all others.</font></p>

        <font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. METTÀ</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first Sublime State is <i>Mettà</i> 
        <i>(Samskrit: Maitri). </i>It means that which softens one's heart, or 
        the state of a true friend. It is defined as the sincere wish for the 
        welfare and genuine happiness of all living beings without exception. It 
        is also explained as the friendly disposition, for a genuine friend 
        sincerely wishes for the welfare of his friend.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Just as a mother 
        protects her only child even at the risk of her life, even so one should 
        cultivate boundless loving-kindness towards all living beings&quot; is 
        the advice of the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is not the passionate 
        love of the mother towards her child that is stressed here but her 
        sincere wish for the genuine welfare of her child.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà is neither carnal 
        love nor personal affection, for grief inevitably arises from both.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà is not mere 
        neighbourliness, for it makes no distinction between neighbours and 
        others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà is not mere 
        universal brotherhood, for it embraces all living beings including 
        animals, our lesser brethren and sisters that need greater compassion as 
        they are helpless.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà is not political 
        brotherhood or racial brotherhood, or national brotherhood, or even 
        religious brotherhood.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Political brotherhood is 
        confined only to those who share similar political views, such as the 
        partial brotherhood of Democrats, Socialists, Communists, and so forth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Racial brotherhood and 
        national brotherhood are restricted only to those of the same race and 
        nation. Some nationalists love their race so much that sometimes they 
        ruthlessly kill innocent men, women and children because they 
        unfortunately are not blessed with blond hair and blue eyes. The white 
        races have particular love for the white skin, the black for the black, 
        the yellow for the yellow, the brown for the brown, the pale for the 
        pale, the red for the red. Others of a different complexion are at times 
        viewed with suspicion and fear. Very often to assert their racial 
        superiority they resort to brutal warfare, killing millions by 
        mercilessly raining bombs from the sky above. The pathetic incidents of 
        the Second World War are striking examples which can never be forgotten 
        by mankind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Amongst some narrow-minded 
        peoples, within the wider circle of their ancient nations, there exist 
        minor circles of caste and class where the so-called brotherhood of the 
        powerful oppressors is so limited that the oppressed are not even 
        permitted to enjoy bare human rights merely because of the accidents of 
        birth or class. These oppressors are to be pitied because they are 
        confined to their water-tight compartments.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà is not religious 
        brotherhood either. Owing to the sad limitations of so-called religious 
        brotherhood human heads have been severed without the least compunction, 
        sincere outspoken men and women have been roasted and burnt alive; many 
        atrocities have been perpetrated which baffle description; cruel wars 
        have been waged which mar the pages of world history. Even in this 
        supposedly enlightened twentieth century the followers of one religion 
        hate or ruthlessly persecute and even kill those of other faiths merely 
        because they cannot force them to think as they do or because they have 
        a different label.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If, on account of religious 
        views, people of different faiths cannot meet on a common platform like 
        brothers and sisters, then surely the missions of compassionate world 
        teachers have pitifully failed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sweet <i>mettà </i>transcends 
        all these kinds of narrow brotherhood. It is limitless in scope and 
        range. Barriers it has none. Discrimination it makes not. Mettà enables 
        one to regard the whole world as one's motherland and all as fellow 
        beings.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Just as the sun sheds its 
        rays on all without any distinction, even so sublime <i>mettà </i>bestows 
        its sweet blessings equally on the pleasant and the unpleasant, on the 
        rich and the poor, on the high and the low, on the vicious and the 
        virtuous, on man and woman, and on human and animal.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such was the boundless <i>Mettà 
        </i>of the Buddha who worked for the welfare and happiness of those who 
        loved Him as well as of those who hated Him and even attempted to harm 
        and kill Him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha exercised <i>mettà 
        </i>equally towards His own son Ràhula, His adversary Devadatta, His 
        attendant Ànanda, His admirers and His opponents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This loving-kindness should 
        be extended in equal measure towards oneself as towards friend, foe and 
        neutral alike. Suppose a bandit were to approach a person travelling 
        through a forest with an intimate friend, a neutral person and an enemy, 
        and suppose he were to demand that one of them be offered as a victim. 
        If the traveller were to say that he himself should be taken, then he 
        would have no <i>mettà </i>towards himself. If he were to say that 
        anyone of the other three persons should be taken, then he would have no 
        <i>mettà </i>towards them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such is the characteristic 
        of real <i>mettà. </i>In exercising this boundless loving-kindness 
        oneself should not be ignored. This subtle point should not be 
        misunderstood, for self-sacrifice is another sweet virtue and 
        egolessness is yet another higher virtue. The culmination of this <i>mettà 
        </i>is the identification of oneself with all beings <i>(sabbattatà),</i> 
        making no difference between oneself and others. The so-called 
        &quot;I&quot; is lost in the whole. Separatism evaporates. Oneness is 
        realized.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is no proper English 
        equivalent for this graceful Pàli term <i>Mettà. </i>Goodwill, 
        loving-kindness, benevolence and universal love are suggested as the 
        best renderings.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The antithesis of <i>mettà 
        </i>is anger, ill-will, hatred, or aversion. <i>Mettà </i>cannot 
        co-exist with anger or vengeful conduct. The Buddha states:</font></p>
        <i>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hatreds do not 
          cease through hatreds:<br>
          </font></i><font face="Times New Roman"><i>through love alone they 
          cease.&quot; (Dhammapada, v. 5)</i></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà not only tends to 
        conquer anger but also does not tolerate hateful thoughts towards 
        others. He who has <i>mettà </i>never thinks of harming others, nor 
        does he disparage or condemn others. Such a person is neither afraid of 
        others nor does he instil fear into any.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A subtle indirect enemy 
        assails <i>mettà </i>in the guise of a friend. It is selfish affection <i>(pema), 
        </i>for unguarded <i>mettà </i>may sometimes be assailed by lust. This 
        indirect enemy resembles a person who lurks afar in the jungles or hills 
        to cause harm to another. Grief springs from affection but not from </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">mettà.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This delicate point should 
        not be misunderstood. Parents surely cannot avoid having affection 
        towards their children and children towards their parents; husbands 
        towards their wives and wives towards their husbands. Such affection is 
        quite natural. The world cannot exist without mutual affection. The 
        point to be clarified here is that unselfish mettà is not synonymous 
        with ordinary affection.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A benevolent attitude is 
        the chief characteristic of <i>inettà. </i>He who practises <i>mettà </i>is 
        constantly interested in promoting the welfare of others. He seeks the 
        good and beautiful in all but not the ugliness in others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Attendant blessings of 
        Mettà</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1) He who practises <i>mettà 
        </i>sleeps happily. As he goes to sleep with a light heart free from 
        hatred he naturally falls asleep at once. This fact is clearly 
        demonstrated by those who are full of loving-kindness. They are fast 
        asleep immediately on closing their eyes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2) As he goes to sleep with 
        a loving heart he awakes with an equally loving heart. Benevolent and 
        compas-sionate persons often rise from bed with smiling faces.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3) Even in sleep loving 
        persons are not perturbed by bad dreams. As they are full of love during 
        their waking hours, they are peaceful in their sleeping hours too. 
        Either they fall into deep sleep or have pleasant dreams.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4) He becomes dear to human 
        beings. As he loves others, so do others love him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When a persons looks at a 
        mirror with a smiling face, a similar face will greet him. If, on the 
        contrary, he looks with a wry face, he will see a similar reflection. 
        The outside world reacts on one in the same way that one acts towards 
        the world. One full of faults himself is apt to see the evil in others. 
        The good he ignores. An English poet -- Bolton Hall -- has put it 
        beautifully: --</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I looked at my 
          brother with the Microscope of</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
          </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Criticism.<br>
          And I said ‘How coarse my brother is!’<br>
          I looked at him through the Telescope of Scorn<br>
          And I said, ‘How small my brother is!’<br>
          Then I looked in the Mirror of Truth<br>
          And I said, ‘How like me my brother is!’ &quot;</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Why should we see the 
        ugliness in others when there is evil in the best of us and good in the 
        worst of us? It would be a source of pleasure to all if we could see the 
        good and beautiful in all.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">5) He who practises <i>mettà 
        </i>is dear to non-humans as well. Animals are also attracted to him. 
        Radiating their loving-kindness, ascetics live in wild forests amidst 
        ferocious beasts without being harmed by them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">6) Owing to his power of <i>mettà 
        </i>he becomes immune from poison and so forth unless he is subject to 
        some inexorable Kamma.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As<i> mettà </i>is a 
        constructive healthy force it has the power to counteract hostile 
        influence. Just as hateful thoughts can produce toxic effects in the 
        system, even so loving thoughts can produce healthy physical effects. It 
        is stated that a very generous and devout woman named Suppiyà, who had 
        a wound in her thigh, was healed on seeing the Buddha. The peaceful 
        thought vibrations of the Buddha and the woman combined to produce this 
        salutary effect.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha visited His 
        birthplace for the first time, His son Ràhula, who was only seven years 
        of age, approached Him and spontaneously remarked: &quot;O ascetic, even 
        your shadow is pleasing to me.&quot; The child was so much dominated by 
        the Buddha's <i>mettà </i>that he deeply felt its magnetic power.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">7) Invisible deities 
        protect him because of the power of his</font><i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        mettà.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">8) Mettà </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">leads 
        to quick mental concentration. As the mind is not perturbed by hostile 
        vibrations one-pointedness can be gained with ease. With mind at peace 
        he will live in a heaven of his own creation. Even those who come in 
        contact with him will also experience that bliss.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">9) Mettà </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">tends 
        to beautify one's facial expression. The face as a rule reflects the 
        state of the mind. When one gets angry, the heart pumps blood twice or 
        three times faster than the normal rate. Heated blood rushes up to the 
        face, which then turns red or black. At times the face becomes repulsive 
        to sight. Loving thoughts on the contrary, gladden the heart and clarify 
        the blood. The face then presents a lovable appearance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is stated that when the 
        Buddha, after Enlightenment, reflected on the Causal Relations <i>(Patthàna), 
        </i>His heart was so pacified and His blood so clarified that rays of 
        different hue such as blue, yellow, red, white, orange, and a mixture of 
        these emanated from His body.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">10) A person imbued with <i>mettà 
        </i>dies peacefully as he harbours no thoughts of hatred towards any. 
        Even after death his serene face reflects his peaceful death.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">11) Since a person with <i>mettà 
        </i>dies happily, he will subsequently be born in a blissful state. If 
        he has gained the Jhànas (ecstasies), he will be born in a Brahma 
        realm.</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Power of Mettà</font></p>
        </i></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Besides these inevitable 
        worldly blessings <i>mettà</i> possesses a magnetic power. It can 
        produce a good influence on others even at a distance and can attract 
        others to oneself.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once when the Buddha 
        visited a certain city, many distinguished nobles came to welcome Him, 
        amongst whom was a nobleman named <i>Roja, </i>who was a friend of 
        Venerable <i>Ànanda. </i>Seeing<i> </i>him, Venerable <i>Ànanda </i>said: 
        &quot;It is very kind of you, Roja, to have come to welcome the 
        Buddha.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No, Venerable Sir, it 
        is not out of any reverence towards the Buddha that I have come to greet 
        Him. We agreed amongst ourselves that whoever would not go to greet the 
        Buddha would be fined 500 gold coins. It is through fear of the fine 
        that I have come here to welcome the Buddha&quot;, replied Roja.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Venerable <i>Ànanda </i>was 
        slightly displeased. He approached the Buddha and implored Him to preach 
        the Dhamma to Roja.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha instantly 
        radiated <i>mettà </i>towards Roja and retired to His chamber.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Roja's body was saturated 
        with the <i>mettà </i>of the Buddha. He was electrified, so to say, 
        with the magnetic power of Buddha's irresistible love. Just as a calf 
        would run after its mother he ran from cell to cell in the monastery 
        inquiring where the Buddha was. The monks directed him to the Buddha's 
        chamber. He knocked at the door. The Buddha opened it. In he went, 
        saluted the Buddha, heard the doctrine, and became a convert.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such is the magnetic power 
        of <i>mettà </i>which everyone can exercise according to his ability.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion an 
        intoxicated elephant was driven towards the Buddha in an effort to kill 
        Him. The Buddha calmly radiated His love towards the elephant and 
        subdued it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A beautiful story may be 
        cited to show how the Bodhisatta as a boy extended his boundless <i>mettà 
        </i>when his own father ordered him to be killed. Young though he was, 
        the Bodhisatta thought to himself:--</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Here is a golden 
        opportunity for me to practise my <i>mettà. </i>My father stands before 
        me, my good mother is weeping, the executioner is ready to chop off my 
        hands and feet. I, the victim, am in the centre. Love I must all the 
        four in equal measure without any distinction. May my good father not 
        incur any suffering because of this ruthless act! May I become a Buddha 
        in the future!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In one of his previous 
        births the Bodhisatta was once practising the virtue of patience in a 
        royal park. The king, a drunkard, meaning to test his patience, ordered 
        the executioner to beat him and cut off his hands and feet. Still he 
        practised patience. The impatient king kicked him in the chest. Lying in 
        a pool of blood, almost on the verge of death, the Bodhisatta blessed 
        the king and wished him long life saying that men like himself never get 
        angry.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A Bhikkhu is expected to 
        practise <i>mettà </i>to such an extent that he is forbidden to dig or 
        cause to dig the ground lest insects and other minute creatures die.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The high standard of <i>mettà 
        </i>expected from a Bhikkhu can be understood by the following 
        admonition of the Buddha:-- &quot;If bandits sever your limbs with a 
        two-handled saw, and if you entertain hate in your heart, you will not 
        be a follower of my teaching.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such enduring patience is 
        extremely difficult. But, that is the lofty ethical standard the Buddha 
        expects from His followers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha Himself has set 
        the noble example:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As an elephant in the 
        battlefield withstands arrows shot from a bow,&quot; says the Buddha, 
        &quot;even so will I endure abuse; verily most people are 
        undisciplined.&quot; (Dhammapada v. 320)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This chaotic, war-weary, 
        restless world of today, where the nations are arming themselves to 
        their teeth, frightened of one another, where human life is endangered 
        by nuclear weapons which may be released at any moment, is sorely in 
        need of this universal loving-kindness so that all may live in one world 
        in perfect peace and harmony like brothers and sisters.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Is it practically possible 
        to exercise <i>mettà </i>when one is threatened with devastating bombs 
        and other destructive weapons?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Well, what can powerless 
        people do when bombs rain from above? Can they avert such a catastrophe?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist <i>mettà </i>is 
        the only answer to such deadly bombs when one is faced with inexorable 
        death.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If all warlike nations 
        could be prevailed upon to substitute this spiritual <i>mettà </i>for 
        the destructive weapons of materialism and rule the world not with might 
        and force but with right and love, then only would there be genuine 
        peace and happiness in this world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Leaving the almost 
        unpractical major issues aside, it is advisable to be concerned with 
        oneself and the rest of mankind in cultivating this sweet virtue of <i>mettà 
        </i>to the best of one's ability.</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How to Practise Mettà</font></p>
        </i></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A few practical hints are 
        given below to practise this meditation on loving-kindness.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        should be practised first towards oneself. In doing so a person should 
        charge his mind and body with positive thoughts of peace and happiness. 
        He should think how he could be peaceful, happy, free from suffering, 
        worry and anger. He then becomes the embodiment of loving-kindness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Shielded by 
        loving-kindness, he cuts off all hostile vibrations and negative 
        thoughts. He returns good for evil, love for anger. He becomes ever 
        tolerant and tries his best not to give occasion for anger to any. 
        Himself beaming with happiness, he injects happiness into others not 
        only inwardly but also outwardly by putting his<i> mettà </i>into 
        practice in the course of his daily life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When he is full of peace 
        and is free from thoughts of hatred, it is easy for him to radiate 
        loving-kindness towards others. What he does not possess he cannot give 
        to others. Before he tries to make others happy he should first be happy 
        himself. He should know the ways and means to make himself happy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He now radiates his 
        loving-kindness towards all his near and dear ones individually and 
        collectively, wishing them peace and happiness and freedom from 
        suffering, disease, worry and anger.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Diffusing his thoughts of 
        loving-kindness towards his relatives and friends, he radiates them also 
        towards neutrals. Just as he wishes for the peace and happiness of 
        himself and of his near and dear ones, even so he sincerely wishes for 
        the peace and happiness of those who are neutral to him, wishing them 
        freedom from suffering, disease, worry and anger. Finally, though this 
        is somewhat difficult, he should radiate his <i>mettà </i>in the same 
        way towards those (if any) who are inimical to him. If, by practising <i>mettà, 
        </i>he could adopt a friendly attitude towards those thought to be 
        inimical towards him, his achievement would be more heroic and 
        commendable. As the Buddha advises --&quot;Amidst those who hate let him 
        live free from hatred.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Starting from himself he 
        should gradually extend his <i>mettà </i>towards all beings, 
        irrespective of creed, race, colour, or sex, including dumb animals, 
        until he has identified himself with all, making no distinction 
        whatever. He merges himself in the whole universe and is one with all. 
        He is no more dominated by egoistic feelings. He transcends all forms of 
        separatism. No longer confining himself to water-tight compartments, no 
        longer influenced by caste, class, national, racial, or religious 
        prejudices, he can regard the whole world as his motherland and all as 
        fellow beings in the ocean of life.</font></p>

        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. KARUNÀ</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second virtue that 
        sublimes man is compassion <i>(karunà). </i>It is defined as that which 
        makes the hearts of the good quiver when others are subject to 
        suffering, or that which dissipates the sufferings of others. Its chief 
        characteristic is the wish to remove the woes of others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The hearts of compassionate 
        persons are even softer than flowers. They do not and cannot rest 
        satisfied until they relieve the sufferings of others. At times they 
        even go to the extent of sacrificing their lives so as to alleviate the 
        sufferings of others. The story of the Vyàghri Jàtaka where the 
        Bodhisatta sacrificed his life to save a starving tigress and her cubs 
        may be cited as an example.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is compassion that 
        compels one to serve others with altruistic motives. A truly 
        compassionate person lives not for himself but for others. He seeks 
        opportunities to serve others expecting nothing in return, not even 
        gratitude.</font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Who needs compassion?</font></p>
        </i></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many amidst us deserve our 
        compassion. The poor and the needy, the sick and the helpless, the 
        lonely and the destitute, the ignorant and the vicious, the impure and 
        the undisciplined are some that demand the compassion of kind-hearted, 
        noble-minded men and women, to whatever religion or to whatever race 
        they belong.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some countries are 
        materially rich but spiritually poor, while some others are spiritually 
        rich but materially poor. Both these pathetic conditions have to be 
        taken into consideration by the materially rich and the spiritually 
        rich.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is the paramount duty of 
        the wealthy to come to the succour of the poor, who unfortunately lack 
        most of the necessaries of life. Surely those who have in abundance can 
        give to the poor and the needy their surplus without inconveniencing 
        themselves.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once a young student 
        removed the door curtain in his house and gave it to a poor person 
        telling his good mother that the door does not feel the cold but the 
        poor certainly do. Such a kindhearted attitude in young men and women is 
        highly commendable.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is gratifying to note 
        that some wealthy countries have formed themselves into various 
        philanthropic bodies to help under-developed countries, especially in 
        Asia, in every possible way. Charitable organizations have also been 
        established in all countries by men, women and students to give every 
        possible assistance to the poor and the needy. Religious bodies also 
        perform their respective duties in this connection in their own humble 
        way. Homes for the Aged, Orphanages and other similar charitable 
        institutions are needed in under-developed countries.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The beggar problem has 
        still to be solved in some countries where begging has become a 
        profession. Out of compassion for the unfortunate beggars this problem 
        has to be solved satisfactorily by the respective Governments as the 
        existence of beggars is an insult to any self-respecting nation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As the materially rich 
        should have compassion on the materially poor and try to elevate them, 
        it is the duty of the spiritually rich, too, to have compassion on the 
        spiritually poor and sublime them though they may be materially rich. 
        Wealth alone cannot give genuine happiness. Peace of mind can be gained 
        not by material treasures but by spiritual treasures. Many in this world 
        are badly in need of substantial spiritual food,<b> </b>which is not 
        easily obtained, as the spiritually poor far exceed the materially poor 
        numerically, as they are found both amongst the rich and the poor.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even more than poverty 
        sickness prevails throughout the world. Many are physically sick, some 
        are mentally sick. Science provides effective medicine for the former 
        but not for the latter, who very often languish in mental hospitals.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are causes for these 
        two kinds of diseases. Compassionate men and women must try to remove 
        the causes if they wish to produce an effective cure.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Effective measures have 
        been employed by various nations to prevent and cure diseases not only 
        of mankind but also of animals. The Buddha set a noble example by 
        attending on the sick Himself and exhorting His disciples with the 
        memorable words:</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He who ministers unto 
        the sick ministers unto</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">me.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some selfless doctors 
        render free services towards the alleviation of suffering. Some expend 
        their whole time and energy in ministering to the poor patients even at 
        the risk of their lives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hospitals and free 
        dispensaries have become a blessing to humanity but more are needed so 
        that the poor may benefit by them. In underdeveloped countries the poor 
        suffer through lack of medical facilities. The sick have to be carried 
        for miles with great inconvenience to the nearest hospital or dispensary 
        for medical treatment. Sometimes they die on the way. Pregnant mothers 
        suffer most. Hospitals, dispensaries, maternity homes, etc. are 
        essential needs in backward village areas.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The lowly and the destitute 
        deserve the compassion of wealthy men and women. Sometimes servants and 
        workers are not well paid, well fed, well clothed and more often than 
        not they are ill treated. Justice is not meted out to them. They are 
        neglected and are powerless as there is nobody to plead for them. 
        Glaring cases of inhuman cruelty receive publicity in some exceptional 
        cases. Many such cases are not known. These unfortunate ones have no 
        other alternative but to suffer meekly even as Mother Earth suffers 
        everything in silence. When the grief is unbearable, they commit suicide 
        in utter desperation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The vicious, the wicked, 
        and the ignorant deserve compassion even, more than those who suffer 
        physically as they are mentally and spiritually sick. They should not be 
        condemned and despised but sympathised with for their failings and 
        defects. Though a mother has equal compassion towards all her children 
        still she may have more compassion towards a sick child. Even so, 
        greater compassion should be exercised towards the spiritually sick as 
        their sickness ruins their character.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, for instance, 
        had great compassion towards the courtesan Ambapàli, and towards 
        Angulimàla the murderer. Both of them later became His converts and 
        underwent a complete reformation in character.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We must understand that 
        greatness is latent in all however wicked they may be. Perhaps one 
        appropriate word at the right moment may change the whole outlook of a 
        person.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Emperor Asoka 
        perpetrated many crimes, so much so that he was stigmatized Asoka the 
        Wicked. Later the words from a young novice -- &quot;Diligence is the 
        path to the deathless&quot; -- produced such a great change in him that 
        he became Asoka the Righteous </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(Dharmàsoka).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's advice is to 
        shun the company of the foolish. That does not mean that the good should 
        not associate with them so as to reform them. People avoid those who 
        suffer from contagious diseases. But compass-sionate physicians, attend 
        on them so as to heal them. Otherwise they might die. In the same way 
        the wicked may die spiritually if the good are not tolerant and 
        compassionate towards them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As a rule the Buddha went 
        in search of the poor, the ignorant and the vicious, but the good and 
        the virtuous came in search of the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Like <i>mettà </i>(loving-kindness), 
        <i>karunà </i>(compassion) should also be extended without limit 
        towards all suffering and helpless beings, including dumb animals and 
        fertile eggs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To deny the rights and 
        privileges of mankind on account of caste, colour, or race is inhuman 
        and cruel. To feast on the flesh of animals by killing or causing them 
        to be killed is not human compassion. To rain bombs from above and 
        ruthlessly destroy millions of men, women and children is the worst form 
        of cruelty that deluded man has ever perpetrated.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Today this pitiless, 
        vengeful world has sacrificed the most precious thing on earth -- life 
        -- at the altar of brute force. Whither has compassion fled?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The world needs today 
        compassionate men and women to banish violence and cruelty from the face 
        of the earth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist compassion, it 
        should be noted<b>, </b>does not consist in mere shedding of tears and 
        the like, for the indirect enemy of compassion is passionate grief </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(domanassa).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Compassion embraces all

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The third sublime virtue is 
        <i>mudità. </i>It is not mere sympathy but sympathetic or appreciative 
        joy which tends to destroy jealousy, its direct enemy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One devastating force that 
        endangers our whole constitution is jealousy. Very often some cannot 
        bear to see or hear the successful achievements of others. They rejoice 
        over their failures but cannot tolerate their successes. Instead of 
        praising and congratulating the successful, they try to ruin, condemn 
        and vilify them. In one way <i>mudità </i>is concerned more with 
        oneself than with others as it tends to eradicate jealousy which ruins 
        oneself. On the other hand it aids others as well since one who 
        practises <i>mudità </i>will not try to hinder the progress and welfare 
        of others.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is quite easy to rejoice 
        over the success of one's near and dear ones, but rather difficult to do 
        so over the success of one's adversaries. Yes, the majority not only 
        find it difficult but also do not and cannot rejoice. They seek delight 
        in creating every possible obstacle so as to ruin their adversaries. 
        They even go to the extent of poisoning, crucifying, and assassinating 
        the good and the virtuous.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Socrates was poisoned, 
        Christ was crucified, Gandhi was shot. Such is the nature of the wicked 
        and deluded world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of <i>mettà </i>and<i> 
        karunà </i>is easier than the practice of <i>mudità </i>which demands 
        great personal effort and strong will-power.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Do the Western nations 
        rejoice over the prosperity of the Eastern and the Eastern over the 
        prosperity of the Weostern? Does one nation rejoice over the welfare of 
        another nation? Is one race happy over the growing prosperity of another 
        race? Does even one religious sect, which stands for the cultivation of 
        morals, rejoice over the spiritual influence of another sect?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One religion is jealous of

        sometimes even one brother or sister is jealous of another brother or

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the very reason why 
        individuals and groups should practise appreciative joy if they wish to

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mudità</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"><b> 
        </b>embraces all prosperous beings and is the congratulatory attitude of 
        a person. It tends to eliminate any dislike <i>(arati) </i>towards a 
        successful person.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4. UPEKKHÀ</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth sublime state is 
        the most difficult and the most essential. It is <i>upekkhà </i>or 
        equanimity. The etymo-logical meaning of the term <i>upekkhà </i>is 
        &quot;discerning rightly,&quot; &quot;viewing justly&quot; or 
        &quot;looking impartially,&quot; that is, without attachment or 
        aversion, without favour or disfavour. (See pp. 523-524 and 596-597).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Equanimity is necessary 
        especially for laymen who have to live in an ill-balanced world amidst 
        fluctuating circumstances.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Slights and insults are the 
        common lot of mankind. The world is so constituted that the good and the 
        virtuous are often subject to unjust criticism and attack. It is heroic 
        to maintain a balanced mind in such circumstances.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Loss and gain, fame and 
        infamy, praise and blame, pain and happiness are eight worldly 
        conditions (atthalokadhamma: gain and loss, fame and defame, praise and 
        blame, happiness and pain) that affect all humanity. Most people are 
        perturbed when affected by such favourable or unfavourable states. One 
        is elated when one is praised, and depressed when blamed and reviled. He 
        is wise, says the Buddha, who, amidst such vicissitudes of life, stands 
        unmoved like unto a firm rock, exercising perfect equanimity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's exemplary life 
        offers us worldlings an excellent example of equanimity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There was no religious 
        teacher in the world who was so severely criticised, attacked, insulted 
        and reviled as the Buddha, and yet none so highly praised, honoured and 
        revered as the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once when He went in quest 
        of alms, He was called an outcast by an impertinent brahmin. He calmly 
        endured the insult and explained to him that it is not birth that makes 
        one an outcast but an ignoble character. The brahmin was converted.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Inviting him to a house for 
        alms, a certain man entertained the Buddha with the filthiest language, 
        current in His time. He was called 'swine', 'brute', ‘ox', etc. But He 
        was not offended. He did not retaliate. Calmly He questioned His host 
        what he would do when guests visited his house. He replied that he would 
        prepare a feast to entertain them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, what would you 
        do if they did not partake of it?&quot; questioned the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In that case we 
        ourselves would partake of the feast.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, good brother, 
        you have invited me to your house for alms. You have entertained me with 
        a torrent of abuse. I do not accept it. Please take it back,&quot; 
        calmly replied the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The offender's character 
        was completely transformed.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Retaliate not. Be 
        silent as a cracked gong when you are abused by others. If you do so, I 
        deem that you have already attained Nibbàna although you have not 
        realized Nibbàna.&quot; (</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammapada 
        v<b>. </b>124)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such is the advice of the 
        Buddha.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are golden words that 
        should be given heed to in this ill-disciplined world of today.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once a lady of the court 
        induced some drunkards to revile the Buddha so much that Venerable 
        Ànanda, His attendant disciple, implored the Buddha to leave the city 
        and go elsewhere. But the Buddha was unperturbed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another woman feigned 
        pregnancy and publicly accused the Buddha of having placed her in that 
        condition. A woman was killed by His rivals and the Buddha was accused 
        of murder. His own cousin and disciple Devadatta made an unsuccessful 
        attempt to crush Him to death by hurling a rock from a cliff. Some of 
        His own disciples accused Him of jealousy, partiality, favouritism, etc.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On<b> </b>the other hand 
        many sang the praises of the Buddha. Kings prostrated themselves before 
        His feet and paid the highest reverence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Like the Mother Earth the 
        Buddha suffered everything in silence with perfect equanimity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Like a lion that does not 
        tremble at every sound, one should not be perturbed by the poisoned 
        darts of uncurbed tongues. Like the wind that does not cling to the 
        meshes of a net, one should not be attached to the illusory pleasures of 
        this changing world. Like the lotus that is unsoiled by the mud from 
        which it springs, one should live unaffected by worldly temptations, 
        ever calm, serene and peaceful.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As with the first three 
        virtues so also <i>upekkhà</i> has for its direct enemy attachment <i>(ràga)</i> 
        and for its indirect enemy callousness or unintelligent indifference.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Upekkhà</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        discards clinging and aversion. An impartial attitude is its chief 
        characteristic. He who practises equanimity is neither attracted by 
        desirable objects nor is averse to undesirable objects.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">His attitude towards the 
        sinner and saint will be the same, for he makes no distinction.</font></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman">* * *</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mettà </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">embraces 
        all beings, <i>karunà </i>embraces sufferers, <i>mudità </i>embraces 
        the prosperous, and <i>upekkhà </i>embraces the good and the bad, the 
        loved and the unloved, the pleasant and the unpleasant.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He who wishes to be divine 
        in<b> </b>this life itself may daily cultivate these four sublime 
        virtues which are dormant in all.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He who wishes to perfect 
        himself and compassionately work for the welfare of all beings in the 
        course of his countless births in <i>Samsàra</i> may strenuously 
        develop the ten Perfections <i>(Pàramì) </i>and ultimately become a <i>Sammà 
        Sambuddha</i>, a Supremely Enlightened One.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He who wishes to eradicate 
        his passions and put an end to suffering by realizing Nibbàna at the 
        earliest possible opportunity may diligently follow the unique Noble 
        Eightfold Path which still exists in its pristine purity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha exhorts:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppose, O monks, 
        this mighty earth were one mass of water and a man were to throw down 
        thereon a yoke with one hole. Then comes a wind from the east and wafts 
        it west, and a wind from the west wafts it east; a north wind wafts it 
        south, and a south wind wafts it north. Then once at the end of a 
        hundred years a blind turtle push his neck through that yoke with one 
        hole whenever he popped up to the surface at the end of a hundred years?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is unlikely, lord, 
        that the blind turtle would do that.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is just as 
        unlikely, O monks, that one will get birth in human form; just as 
        unlikely that a Tathàgata should arise in the world, an Arahant, a 
        Fully Enlightened One; just as unlikely that the Norm <i>(Dhamma) </i>and 
        Discipline <i>(Vinaya) </i>proclaimed by a Tathàgata should be shown in 
        the world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But now indeed, O 
        monks, this state of human birth is won, and a Tathàgata has arisen in 
        the world, and the Norm and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathàgata is 
        shown in the world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Wherefore, O monks, 
        ye must make an effort to realize: This is ill, this is the cause of 
        ill, this is the cessation of ill, this is the way leading to the 
        cessation of ill.&quot; (<i>Kindred Sayings</i>, v. p. 334)</font></p>
