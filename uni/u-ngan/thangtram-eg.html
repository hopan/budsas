        not absolutely rosy. Nor is it totally thorny. The rose is soft, 
        beautiful and fragrant. But the stem on which it grows is full of 
        thorns. What is rosy is rosy; what is thorny is thorny. Because of the 
        rose one will not meddle with the thorns nor will one disparage the rose 
        on account of the thorns.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To an optimist this world 
        is absolutely rosy; to a pessimist this world is absolutely thorny. But

        a realistic standpoint.</font></p>

        will not be infatuated by the beauty of the rose but will view it as it

        and will take the precaution not to be wounded.</font></p>

        LOSS</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Business men, as a rule, 
        are subject to both gain <i>(làbha)</i> and loss <i>(alàbha)</i>. It 
        is quite natural to be complacent in obtaining a gain or a profit. In 
        itself there is nothing wrong. Such righteous or unrighteous profits 
        produce some pleasure which average men seek. Without pleasurable 
        moments, though temporary, life would not be worth living. In this 
        competitive and chaotic world rarely do people enjoy some kind of 
        happiness which gladdens their hearts. Such happiness, though material, 
        does conduce to health and longevity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The problem arises in case 
        of loss. Profits one can bear smilingly but not so the losses. More 
        often than not they lead to mental derangement and sometimes to suicide 
        when the losses are unbearable. It is under such adverse circumstances 
        that one should exhibit moral courage and maintain a balanced mind. All 
        have ups and downs while battling with life. One should always be 
        prepared for the losses in particular. Then there will be less 
        disappointment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When something is stolen 
        naturally one feels sad. But by becoming sad one would not be able to 
        retrieve the loss. One should think that someone had benefited thereby 
        though unrighteously. May he be well and happy!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Or one can console oneself 
        thinking:-- &quot;It's only a minor loss.&quot; One may even adopt a 
        highly philosophical attitude &quot;there is nothing to be called Me or 
        Mine.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the Buddha 
        once a noble lady was offering food to the Venerable Sàriputta and some 
        monks. While serving them she received a note stating that her husband 
        and all her sons who had gone to settle a dispute were waylaid and 
        killed. Without getting upset, calmly she kept the note in her 
        waist-pouch and served the monks as if nothing had happened. A maid, who 
        was carrying a pot of ghee to offer to the monks, inadvertently slipped 
        and broke the pot of ghee. Thinking that the lady would naturally feel 
        sorry over the loss, Venerable Sàriputta consoled her, saying that all 
        breakable things are bound to break. The wise lady unperturbly remarked 
        -- &quot;Bhante, what is this trivial loss? I have just received a note 
        stating that my husband and sons were killed by some assassins. I placed 
        it in my pouch without losing my balance. I am serving you all despite 
        the loss.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Such valour on the part of 
        courageous women is highly commendable.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once the Buddha went 
        seeking alms in a village. Owing to the intervention of Màra the Evil 
        One, the Buddha did not obtain any food. When Màra questioned the 
        Buddha rather sarcastically whether He was hungry or not, the Buddha 
        solemnly explained the mental attitude of those who are free from 
        Impediments, and replied:-- &quot;Ah, happily do we live, we who have no 
        Impediments. Feeders of joy shall we be even as the gods of the Radiant 
        Realm.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On another occasion the 
        Buddha and His disciples observed <i>vassa </i>(rainy period) in a 
        village at the invitation of a brahmin, who, however, completely forgot 
        his duty to attend to the needs of the Buddha and the Sangha. Throughout 
        a period of three months, although Venerable Moggallàna volunteered to 
        obtain food by his psychic powers, the Buddha, making no complaint, was 
        contented with the fodder of horses offered by a horse-dealer.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Visàkhà, the Buddha's 
        chief female lay disciple, used to frequent the monastery to attend to 
        the needs of the Buddha and the Sangha decked with a very valuable outer 
        garment. On entering the monastery, she used to remove it and give it to 
        the maid for safe custody. Once the maid inadvertently left it in the 
        temple and returned home. Venerable Œnanda, noticing it, kept it in a 
        safe place to be given to Visàkhà when she visited the monastery. 
        Visàkhà discovering the loss advised the maid to look for it but not 
        to take it back in case any Bhikkhu had touched it. On inquiry the maid 
        understood that Venerable Œnanda had kept it in safe custody. Returning 
        home, she reported the matter.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Visàkhà visited the 
        monastery and inquired of the Buddha what meritorious act should she 
        perform with the money obtained by selling the costly garment. The 
        Buddha advised her to build a monastery for<i> </i>the benefit of the 
        Sangha. As there was nobody to buy the garment because of its high cost, 
        she herself bought it and built a monastery and offered it to the 
        Sangha. After the offering, she expressed her gratitude to the maid, 
        saying:-- &quot;If you had not inadvertently left my garment, I would 
        not have got an opportunity to perform this meritorious act. Please 
        share the merit.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Instead of grieving over 
        the temporary loss and reprimanding the maid for her carelessness she 
        thanked her for granting an opportunity for service.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The exemplary attitude of 
        cultured Visàkhà is a memorable lesson to all those who are quickly 
        irritated over the misdoings of helpless servants.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Losses one must try to bear 
        cheerfully with manly vigour. Unexpectedly one confronts them, very 
        often in groups and not singly. One must face them with equanimity <i>(upekkhà) 
        </i>and think it is an opportunity to practise that sublime virtue.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Fame <i>(yasa)</i> and 
        defame <i>(ayasa)</i> are another pair of inevitable worldly conditions 
        that confront us in the course of our daily lives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Fame we welcome, defame we 
        dislike. Fame gladdens our mind, defame disheartens us. We desire to 
        become famous. We long to see our names and pictures appear in the 
        papers. We are greatly pleased when our activities, however 
        insignificant, are given publicity. Sometimes we seek undue publicity 
        too.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To see their picture in a 
        magazine some are ready to pay any amount. To obtain an honour some are 
        prepared to offer any bribe or give a fat donation to the party in 
        power. For the sake of publicity some exhibit their generosity by giving 
        alms to one hundred monks and even more, but they may be totally 
        indifferent to the sufferings of the poor and the needy in the 
        neighbourhood. One may charge and punish a starving person who, to 
        appease his hunger, were to steal a coconut in his garden, but would not 
        hesitate to present thousand coconuts to get a good name.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are human frailties.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most people do even a good 
        action with an ulterior motive. Selfless persons who act disinterestedly 
        are rare in this world. Even if the motive is not very praiseworthy, 
        those who do any good are to be congratulated on having done a 
        beneficial act. Most worldlings have something up their sleeves. Well, 
        who is hundred percent good? How many are perfectly pure in their 
        motives? How many are absolutely altruistic?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We need not hunt after 
        fame. If we are worthy of fame, it will come to us unsought. The bee 
        will be attracted to the flower, laden with honey. The flower however, 
        does not invite the bee.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">True indeed, we feel 
        naturally happy, nay extremely happy, when our fame is spread far and 
        wide. But we must realize that fame, honour and glory only lead to the 
        grave. They vanish in thin air. Empty words are they, though pleasing to 
        the ear.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What about defame? It is 
        not palatable either to the ear or mind. We are undoubtedly perturbed 
        when unkind defamatory words pierce our ears. The pain of mind is still 
        greater when the so-called report is unjust and absolutely false.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Normally it takes years to 
        erect a magnificent building. In a minute or two, with modern 
        devastating weapons, it could easily be demolished. Sometimes it takes 
        years or a lifetime to build up a good reputation. In no long time the 
        hard-earned good name can be ruined. Nobody is exempt from the devasting 
        remark beginning with the infamous &quot;but&quot;. Yes, he is very 
        good, he does this and that, but... His whole good record is blackened 
        by the so-called &quot;but&quot;. You may live the life of a Buddha, but 
        you will not be exempt from criticism, attacks and insults.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was the most

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some antagonists of the 
        Buddha spread a rumour that a woman used to spend the night in the 
        monastery. Foiled in this base attempt, they spread a false rumour 
        amongst the populace that the Buddha and His disciples murdered that 
        very woman and hid her corpse in the rubbish-heap of withered flowers 
        within the monastery. When His historic mission met with success and 
        when many sought ordination under Him, His adversaries maligned Him, 
        saying that He was robbing the mothers of their sons, depriving wives of 
        their husbands, and that He was obstructing the progress of the nation. 
        Failing in all these attempts to ruin His noble character, His own 
        cousin and a jealous disciple of His, attempted to kill him by hurling a 
        rock from above.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Being a Buddha, He could 
        not be killed.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The higher you climb a 
        hill, the more conspicuous you become and much smaller in the eyes of 
        others. Your back is revealed but your front is hidden. The 
        fault-finding world exhibits your shortcomings and misdoings but hides 
        your salient virtues. The winnowing fan ejects the husks but retains the 
        grains: the strainer, on the contrary, retains the gross remnants but 
        drains out the sweet juice. The cultured take the subtle and remove the 
        gross; the uncultured retain the gross and reject the subtle.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When you are 
        misrepresented, deliberately or undeliberately unjustly reported, as 
        Epictetus advises, it is wise to think or say -- &quot;O, by his slight 
        acquaintanceship and little knowledge of myself I am slightly 
        criticised. But if I am known better, more serious and much greater 
        would be the accusations against me.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is needless to waste 
        time in correcting the false reports unless circumstances compel you to 
        necessitate a clarification. The enemy is gratified when he sees that 
        you are hurt. That is what he actually expects. If you are indifferent,

        looking at His image. They are a subject of meditation to the devout. 
        Those well-merited virtues are still a great inspiration to His 
        followers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What about blame&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha says:--</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;They who speak much 
        are blamed. They who speak a little are blamed. They who are silent are 
        also blamed. In this world there is none who is not blamed.&quot;</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Blame seems to be a 
        universal legacy to mankind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The majority of the people 
        in the world, remarks the Buddha, are ill-disciplined. Like an<b> </b>elephant 
        in the battle-field that endures all arrows shot at him, even so, the 
        Buddha says, do I suffer all insults.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The deluded and the wicked 
        are prone to seek only the ugliness in others but not the good and 
        beautiful.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">None, except the Buddha, is 
        hundred percent good. Nobody is hundred percent bad either. There is 
        evil in the best of us. There is good in the worst of us. He who 
        silences himself like a cracked gong when attacked, insulted and abused, 
        he, I say, the Buddha exhorts, is in the presence of Nibbàna although 
        he has not yet attained Nibbàna.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One may work with the best 
        of motives. But the outside world very often misconstrues him and will 
        impute motives never even dreamt of.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One may serve and help 
        others to the best of one's ability sometimes by incurring debt or 
        selling one's articles or property to save a friend in<b> </b>trouble. 
        But later, the deluded world is so constituted that those very persons 
        whom one has helped will find fault with him, blackmail him, blemish his 
        good character and will rejoice in his downfall.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Jàtaka stories it 
        is stated that Guttila the musician taught everything he knew to his 
        pupil without a closed fist, but the ungrateful man he was, he 
        unsuccessfully tried to compete with his teacher and ruin him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta, a pupil and 
        cousin of the Buddha who had developed psychic powers, not only tried to 
        discredit the Buddha but also made an unsuccessful attempt to crush Him 
        to death by hurling a rock from above while He was pacing up and down 
        below.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On one<b> </b>occasion the 
        Buddha was invited by a brahmin for alms to his house. As He was 
        invited, the Buddha visited his house. Instead of entertaining Him, he 
        poured forth a torrent of abuse with the filthiest of words.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha politely 
        inquired:-</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do visitors come to 
        your house good brahmin?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes&quot;, he 
        replied.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What do you do when 
        they come?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh, we prepare a 
        sumptuous feast.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If they fail to turn 
        up, please?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why, we gladly 
        partake of it.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, good brahmin, 
        you have invited me for alms and entertained me with abuse. I accept 
        nothing.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Please take it back.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not 
        retaliate, but politely gave back what the brahmin gave Him. Retaliate 
        not, the Buddha exhorts. Vengeance will be met with vengeance. Force 
        will be met with force. Bombs will be met with bombs. &quot;Hatreds do 
        not cease through hatreds, but through love alone they cease&quot; is a 
        noble utterance of the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There was no religious 
        teacher so highly praised and so severely criticised, reviled and blamed 
        like the Buddha. Such is the fate of great men.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In a public assembly a vile 
        woman named Cincà feigning pregnancy, maligned the Buddha. With a 
        smiling face the Buddha patiently endured the insult and the Buddha's 
        innocence was proved.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was accused of 
        murdering a woman assisted by His disciples. Non-Buddhists severely 
        criticised the Buddha and His Disciples to such an extent that the 
        Venerable Œnanda appealed to the Buddha to leave for another village.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-- &quot;How, Œnanda, if 
        those villagers also abuse us?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-- &quot;Well then, Lord, 
        we will proceed to another village.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">-- &quot;Then Œnanda, the 
        whole of India will have no place for us. Be patient. These abuses will 
        automatically cease.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Màgandiyà, a lady of the 
        harem, had a grudge against the Buddha for speaking ill of her 
        attractive figure when her father, through ignorance, wished to give her 
        in marriage to the Buddha. She hired drunkards to insult the Buddha in 
        public. With perfect equanimity the Buddha endured the insults. But 
        Màgandiyà had to suffer for her misdemeanour.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Insults are the common lot 
        of humanity. The more you work and the greater you become, the more are 
        you subject to insult and humiliation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Jesus Christ was insulted, 
        humiliated and crucified.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Socrates was insulted by 
        his own wife. Whenever he went out to help others his intolerant wife 
        used to scold him. One day as she was unwell she failed to perform her 
        unruly task. Socrates left home on that day with a sad face. His friends 
        inquired why he was sad. He replied that his wife did not scold him on 
        that day as she was unwell.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, you ought to be 
        happy for not getting that unwelcome scolding,&quot; remarked his 
        friends.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh no! When she 
        scolds me I get an opportunity to practise patience. Today I missed it. 
        That is the reason why I am sad,&quot; answered the philosopher.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are memorable lessons 
        for all.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When insulted we should 
        think that we are being given an opportunity to practise patience. 
        Instead of being offended, we should be grateful to our adversaries.</font></p>

        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">HAPPINESS 
        and PAIN</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Happiness <i>(sukha) </i>and 
        pain <i>(dukkha) </i>are the last pair of opposites. They are the most 
        powerful factors that affect mankind. What can be endured with ease is <i>sukha 
        </i>(happiness), what is difficult to bear is <i>dukkha </i>(pain). 
        Ordinary happiness is the gratification of a desire. No sooner is the 
        desired thing gained than we desire some other kind of happiness. So 
        insatiate are our selfish desires. The enjoyment of sensual pleasures is 
        the highest and only happiness to an<b> </b>average person. There is no 
        doubt a momentary<i> </i>happiness in the anticipation, gratification 
        and recollection of such material pleasures highly priced by the 
        sensualist, but they are illusory and temporary.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Can material possessions 
        give one genuine happiness?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If so, millionaires would 
        not think of committing suicide. In a certain country which has reached 
        the zenith of material progress about ten percent suffer from mental 
        diseases. Why should it be so if material possessions alone can give 
        genuine happiness?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Can dominion over the whole 
        world produce true happiness?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Alexander, who triumphantly 
        marched to India, conquering the lands on the way, sighed for not having 
        more pieces of earth to conquer.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Are Emperors and Kings who 
        wear crowns always happy?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Very often the lives of 
        statesmen who wield power are at stake. The pathetic cases of Mahatma 
        Gandhi and J. F. Kennedy are illustrative examples.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Real happiness is found 
        within, and is not to be defined in terms of wealth, power, honours or 
        conquests.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If such worldly possessions 
        are forcibly or unjustly obtained, or are misdirected, or even viewed 
        with attachment, they will be a source of pain and sorrow for the 
        possessors. What is happiness to one may not be happiness to another. 
        What is meat and drink to one may be poison to another.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha enumerates four 
        kinds of happiness for a layman.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They are the happiness of 
        possession <i>(atthi sukha)</i>, namely, health, wealth, longevity, 
        beauty, joy, property, strength, children, etc.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second source of 
        happiness is derived by the enjoyment of such possessions <i>(bhoga 
        sukha). </i>Ordinary men and women wish to enjoy themselves. The Buddha 
        does not advise all to renounce their worldly pleasures and retire to 
        solitude.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The enjoyment of wealth 
        lies not only in using it for ourselves but also in giving it for the 
        welfare of others. What we eat is only temporary. What we preserve we 
        leave and go. What we give we take with us. We are remembered for ever 
        by the good deeds we have done with our worldly possessions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Not falling into debt <i>(ananasukha) 
        </i>is another source of happiness. If we are contented with what we 
        have and if we are economical, we need not be in debt to any one. 
        Debtors live in mental agony and are under obligation to their 
        creditors. Though poor, when debt free, you feel relieved and are 
        mentally happy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Leading a blameless life <i>(anavajjasukha) 
        </i>is one of the best sources of happiness for a layman. A blameless 
        person is a blessing to himself and to others. He is admired by all and 
        feels happier, being affected by the peaceful vibrations of others. It 
        should be stated however that it is very, very difficult to get a good 
        name from all. The noble-minded persons are concerned only with a 
        blameless life and are indifferent to external approbation. The majority 
        in this world delight themselves in enjoying pleasures while some others 
        seek delight in renouncing them. Non-attachment or the transcending of 
        material pleasures is happiness to the spiritual. Nibbànic bliss, which 
        is a bliss of relief from suffering, is the highest form of happiness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ordinary happiness we 
        welcome, but not its opposite -- pain, which is rather difficult to 
        endure.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Pain or suffering comes in 
        different guises.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We suffer when we are 
        subject to old age which is natural. With equanimity we have to bear the 
        sufferings of old age.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">More painful than 
        sufferings due to old<i> </i>age are sufferings caused by disease, 
        which, if chronic, we feel that death is preferable. Even the slightest 
        toothache or headache is sometimes unbearable.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we are subject to 
        disease, without being<b> </b>worried, we should be able to bear it at 
        any cost. Well, we must console ourselves thinking that we have escaped 
        from a still more serious disease.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Very often we are separated 
        from our near and dear ones. Such separation causes great pain of mind. 
        We should understand that all association must end with separation. Here 
        is a good opportunity to practise equanimity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">More often than not we are 
        compelled to be united with the unpleasant which we detest. We should be 
        able to bear them. Perhaps we are reaping the effects of our own Kamma, 
        past or present. We should try to accommodate ourselves to the new 
        situation or try to overcome the obstacle by some means or other.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even the Buddha, a perfect 
        being, who has destroyed all defilements, had to endure physical 
        suffering caused by disease and accidents.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was constantly 
        subject to headache. His last illness caused Him much physical 
        suffering. As a result of Devadatta's hurling a rock to kill Him, His 
        foot was wounded by a splinter which necessitated an operation. 
        Sometimes He was compelled to starve. At times He had to be contented 
        with horse-fodder. Due to the disobedience of His own pupils, He was 
        compelled to retire to a forest for three months. In the forest, on a 
        couch of leaves spread on rough ground, facing piercing cool winds, He 
        slept with perfect equanimity. Amidst pain and happiness He lived with a 
        balanced mind. Death is the greatest sorrow we are compelled to face in 
        the course of our wanderings in <i>samsàra. </i>Sometimes, death comes 
        not singly but in numbers which may even cause insanity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Patàcàrà lost her near 
        and dear ones -- parents, husband, brother and two children -- and she 
        went mad. The Buddha consoled her.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Kisà Gotami lost her only 
        infant, and she went in search of a remedy for her dead son, carrying 
        the corpse. She approached the Buddha and asked for a remedy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, sister, can you<b> 
        </b>bring some mustard seed?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Certainly, 
        Lord!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But, sister, it 
        should be from a house where no one has died.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mustard seeds she found, 
        but not a place where death had not visited.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">She understood the nature 
        of life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When a mother was 
        questioned why she did not weep over the tragic death of her only son, 
        she replied; &quot;Uninvited he came, uninformed he went. As he came, so 
        he went. Why should we weep? What avails weeping?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As fruits fall from a tree 
        -- tender, ripe or old -- even so we die in our infancy, in the prime of 
        manhood or even in old age.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The sun rises in the East 
        only to set in the West.</font></p>
